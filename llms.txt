## Plugin Node Upgrade Guide
This guide outlines the process of upgrading Plugin Node from version 2.0 to 2.4 while transitioning from Ubuntu 20.04 to 24.04, all while preserving the existing node address. A hard reset and fresh installation normally result in a new node address. However, maintaining the current address provides key advantages:

- No need to withdraw or transfer funds

- Seamless access to deposited XDC and PLI

- Easier adoption of Plugin 2.4’s new features


Upgrading to Ubuntu 24.04 is essential for long-term security and support. By following this approach, node operators can streamline the upgrade process while minimizing operational disruptions.

1. **General Questions**


**What is the ETA for a ticket?**

The updated ETA for a ticket is 05 - 30 minutes during office hours and 12-24 hours during weekends. To drive the issue to the closure we suggest a detailed explanation of the issue with more details.

**What should I do in case I accidentally sent my PLI Tokens to Plugin Mainnet address?**

The Team/User would not be able to refund or withdraw the PLI tokens sent to Plugin Mainnet.

**What should I do in case I accidentally sent my PLI Tokens to my node address?**

Firstly, you will be able to withdraw tokens from your node address only if your node is active. If your node is deactivated and deleted then the withdrawal will not work, and tokens will be lost. Refer to this link [https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/withdraw-pli-from-plugin-node](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/withdraw-pli-from-plugin-node) to withdraw your tokens from your node

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-have-all-my-plis-in-exchanges-or-other-wallets.-should-i-transfer-all-the-plis-to-xdcpay)    I have all my PLIs in Exchanges or other wallets. Should I transfer all the PLIs to XDCPay?

Not necessary, only the required amount that is to be staked could be in XDCPay. Also, we need to communicate with your XDCPay wallet for reward transfer using web3.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#my-old-phone-broke-before-i-was-able-to-transfer-google-authenticator-to-my-new-phone.-how-do-i-fix)    My old phone broke before I was able to transfer Google Authenticator to my new phone. How do I fix this?

Open a new ticket or send a mail to support@goplugin.co with the details such as username and email address, and we will perform the 2FA Reset.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#how-does-the-penalty-work)    How does the penalty work?

If there is any downtime, the percentage of the reward will be in proportion to the uptime. In case of any bad behavior, like misleading information or inputs will allow the PLUGIN team to deactivate your Node.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#can-i-host-more-than-1-node)    Can I host more than 1 Node?

Yes, you are free to set up more than 1 node now. We are allowing the node operators to set up a maximum of 4 nodes at the moment.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#how-long-the-staking-period-will-be)    How long the staking period will be?

The staking period is 1 Year. During this time, your token will be locked in the smart contract.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-purchased-pli-tokens-in-exchange-can-i-run-the-node-using-that)    I purchased PLI tokens in exchange?, can I run the node using that

Yes certainly you can but are required to move the PLI tokens to any of the wallets mentioned below: XDCPay

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#can-i-stake-more-than-2000-pli-per-node)    Can I stake more than 2000 PLI per node?

Yes, please!. The maximum stake allowed per node is 20000 PLI tokens now. However, 2000 PLI is the minimum staking requirement per node.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#what-details-should-i-take-care-of-before-sending-node-details-for-approval)    What details should I take care of before sending node details for approval?

Firstly the details of the node have to be accurate, the IP address should be active and not contain any extra characters (6689/ https://), and fulfillment and alarm clock testing have to be done. The wallet address should be loaded with some PLIs, and the node should be on the mainnet.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-do-not-have-a-pli-token-how-do-i-purchase-it)    I do not have a PLI token, how do I purchase it?

You are free to purchase from the following exchanges (XT, Bitrue, Bitmart, Probit, HitBTC, Globiance - Check the index pair on our website [www.goplugin.co](http://www.goplugin.co/))

**I want to delete my node that was approved, but not yet staked. What should I do?**

Firstly mention if you are creating a new node, and if yes, is there any change in the node address and wallet address.

Please contact the team and we will return the node and update the status of the node, but the only thing is, once you reenter the details, the node will go through the approval process once again from the start.

1. **Staking Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#what-if-my-node-is-deactivated-by-myself-can-i-un-stake-it)    What if my node is deactivated by myself? Can I un-stake it?

No, you will have to wait till the staking or lock-in period is over, otherwise, a pre-closure withdrawal penalty would be imposed as decided by the Governance Committee.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#how-do-i-stake)    How do I stake

Firstly, the node should be approved, and only after this would you be able to stake on a node. Refer to the link [https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/how-to-stake-pli-token-for-plugin-node](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/how-to-stake-pli-token-for-plugin-node).

You have to stake 2000 PLI tokens in our smart contract.

1. **Wallet Address Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-want-to-change-my-default-wallet-address-on-my-active-node-how-do-i-do-it)    I want to change my default wallet address on my active node, how do I do it?

To change your default wallet address on your active node, you will have to unstake the node and rebuild it with the new wallet address.

**Is it possible to change the wallet address if the wallet is compromised?**

In case the wallet of the approved nodes are compromised/hacked or the seed phrase is lost, the Plugin Team will not be able to help. We will not be able to update the wallet address of the active nodes, as they are linked on Blockchain. Therefore, there would be no option to retrieve the tokens staked, unless the wallet is recovered.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#why-am-i-unable-to-sync-my-wallet-to-my-profile)    Why am I unable to sync my wallet to my profile?

Disable all other wallets and restart the browser, then login to XDCPay 1st and then log in to the dashboard, and try to sync your wallet address which is registered on the Plugin platform.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-am-not-able-to-top-up-on-my-node.-what-should-i-do)    I am not able to top up on my node. What should I do?

Please refer to the link “ [https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/how-to-add-more-stake-in-node](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/how-to-add-more-stake-in-node) “ to add more stake to your node. Currently, the maximum you can top up is 18000 PLI tokens. (Please check our Discord/Tweets to know about any changes from time to time)

1. **Node Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#can-i-create-a-new-node-after-unstaking-and-use-the-exact-wallet-address-and-node-address)    Can I create a new node after unstaking and use the exact wallet address and node address?

The wallet address can be the same, but the node address will change for sure. The IP address can also be the same in case you want it to be, but in that case, you will have to send the team a request for a backend update, after which you will be able to use the same IP address for your node.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#can-i-make-a-new-node-without-using-the-old-backups)    Can I make a new node without using the old backups

Yes, you can make a new node without using backups, but if you want to use the node with the same IP address and other details, then a backup will be needed. (Please ensure you have used the latest script for the node installation).

**I am unable to access my plugin GUI. What to do?**

Can you see 6688 and 6689 as open? If you run sudo ufw allow 6688 and sudo ufw allow 6689 commands, it should work. Then open google online port scanner and enter your IP address and each port to ensure it's reachable. Make sure your firewalls are not blocking this service.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#do-inactive-nodes-count-towards-a-cap-if-there-is-one)    Do inactive nodes count towards "a cap" if there is one?

Only active nodes are counted.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#the-login-session-node-details-and-wallet-balance-are-just-loading-and-dont-display-the-correct-info)    The login session, node details, and wallet balance are just loading and don't display the correct information.

Please refresh your browser, and make sure only XDCPay is running on this browser. Followed by logging out and logging in to the dashboard. Just give it some time.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-am-getting-an-error-while-submitting-my-node)    I am getting an error while submitting my node.

Please make sure, you have pointed to your registered XDCPay wallet, and all other wallets like Metamask, etc. should be disabled and used in a different browser. After a refresh, log in and complete the transaction.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#my-server-crashed-and-i-lost-my-node.-what-should-i-do)    My server crashed and I lost my node. What should I do?

This mostly happens, if the node is not frequently given a review. So would recommend every node operator review your node and make sure it is up-to-date with security patches. Due to unforeseen circumstances if it goes down, then follow the below steps.

Submit a ticket with valid justification and server issue details, such as server-down details for quick approval from the Governance committee end. Wait for a response in the Ticket. Once you get a "nod" from a committee, you can proceed with "Withdrawal".

**What should I do when I want to back up and restore my node?**

The following links are related to

Backup - [https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment/blob/main/docs/node\_backup\_restore.md#performing-a-backup](https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment/blob/main/docs/node_backup_restore.md#performing-a-backup) ;

Restore - [https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment/blob/main/docs/node\_backup\_restore.md#performing-a-restore](https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment/blob/main/docs/node_backup_restore.md#performing-a-restore) ;

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#what-should-i-do-when-i-want-to-change-my-ip-address-after-a-restore)    What should I do when I want to change my IP address after a restore?

Please confirm that your reinstalled nodes, node address, and wallet address are the same as your previous setup. Also, please ensure Alarm clock testing is done for the newly set-up node. And then open a new ticket with the IP addresses.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#do-i-need-to-submit-the-alarm-clock-test-job-for-review)    Do I need to submit the "Alarm" clock test job for review?

Ensuring your node is running fine is most important before you submit the node details for review. So "alarm" clock testing is necessary for the same. But you need not submit the same in the "Job" submission section in " [oracles.goplugin.co](https://oracles.goplugin.co/)"

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#my-node-went-down-is-there-any-impact-on-my-staked-pli)    My node went down, is there any impact on my staked PLI?

No, the staked PLI is at the "Contract" level. So your staked PLI is safe. But please keep in mind, that when you are resetting the node, the same node address is necessary to reuse the node.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#what-should-i-do-in-case-i-accidentally-sent-my-pli-tokens-to-my-node-address)    What should I do in case I accidentally sent my PLI Tokens to my node address?

Firstly, you will be able to withdraw tokens from your node address only if your node is active. If your node is deactivated and deleted then the withdrawal will not work, and tokens will be lost. Refer to this link [https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/withdraw-pli-from-plugin-node](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/withdraw-pli-from-plugin-node) to withdraw your tokens from your node

1. **Reputation Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#why-is-my-reputation-value-0)    Why is my reputation value 0?

Firstly make sure to check the status within my nodes list (not on the dashboard). Once the node is approved and active, give the node some time and make sure to have zero or next to very minimal downtime of the node. In case of downtime, the reputation will be minimum. If downtime is minimal, check whether the IP address is active. If your IP address is inactive, open ports 6688 and 6689 using “sudo ufw allow 6688 “ and “sudo ufw allow 6689”. Check the pm2 logs for errors

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#why-is-my-reputation-showing-as-0-on-the-dashboard)    Why is my reputation showing as 0 on the dashboard?

The main dashboard says zero for everyone, you need to go into the nodes to see the individual scores for each node. Be sure to check your actual nodes once in a while as well with pm2 status to make sure they are online and your restart counter isn't increasing. Also, please check this link for regular node maintenance [https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/node-maintenance-instructions-for-node-operators](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/node-maintenance-instructions-for-node-operators)

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#why-is-my-node-reputation-going-down)    Why is my node reputation going down

Reputation calculation is ready with the basic algorithm. All you have to do is, keep your node running 24/7 and ensure the high availability of nodes. Random verification of the node is scheduled and it happens every day. So if your node goes down even a day, the reputation for the month is -- 29/30 and it calculates the rating for the month accordingly.

1. **Migration Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#i-want-to-switch-to-a-new-server-how-do-i-migrate)    I want to switch to a new "Server", how do I migrate?

We have a backup mechanism in place, in a newly set up automated script. If you have set up a node using the legacy method, you should be able to take a backup of your DB, node files into the new server. Check our Discord channel for more information

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#how-can-i-migrate-to-a-new-server)    How can I migrate to a new Server?

We have a backup mechanism in place, in a newly set up automated script. If you have set up a node using the same, you should be able to take a backup of your DB, and node files into the new server. -- No re-staking is required if the node and wallet address is the same.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#what-if-i-want-to-migrate-my-node)    What if I want to migrate my node?

You can migrate to the same local machine if you have all the backups. But just make sure, before migrating make a note of the Oracle address, node address, and wallet address. After migrating, check if there are any changes in these 3 parameters. If there are changes then you will have to unstake and stake in a new node. The staking period will remain the same if you migrate the node using the backups. For taking a backup, please refer to the link [https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment/blob/main/docs/node\_backup\_restore.md#performing-a-backup](https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment/blob/main/docs/node_backup_restore.md#performing-a-backup)

1. **Data feeds Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#can-i-also-support-connecting-plugin-to-data-feed-providers)    Can I also support connecting Plugin to data Feed providers?

Yes, you are welcome. We have a sound business model for Data Feed providers as well as for Node Operators, who provide their services as data feed providers or connect plugins to Data Feed Providers. To know more, you may approach us at info@goplugin.co.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#where-can-i-find-plugin-data-feeds)    Where can I find Plugin Data Feeds?

[https://feeds.goplugin.co/](https://feeds.goplugin.co/) is the place where you can check out our data feeds.

1. **Unstaking Related Queries**


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#what-should-i-do-when-i-need-to-unstake-more-than-1-node)    What should I do when I need to unstake more than 1 node

Please go through the topic "What happens to my rewards when I unstake, rebuild my node, and restake?" in the link “ [https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq) ” and provide your confirmation for unstaking by opening a new ticket and presenting the reason to our Governance Committee. The nodes will be deactivated one by one, by which we mean, first, deactivating one node, then building it up, followed by the other nodes, as by this we can get nodes up one by one. The request will be processed only if the reason was found valid.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/support/faq\#can-i-un-stake-or-request-for-early-release)    Can I un-stake or request for early release?

Only node operators with a high reputation can request for un-stake or early release. In other cases of emergency of the Node Operator, the Governance Committee will take a considerate decision on receipt of the request.

1. **Reward Related Queries**


**How does the reward/incentivization logic work?**

You will be receiving -The monthly reward for minimum staking of 2,000 PLI tokens will remain at 10%; For any top-up staked between 2,001 to 10,000 PLI tokens, the monthly reward will be 5%; For the top-up from 10,001 to 20,000 PLI tokens, the monthly reward will be 2.5%.

A good reputation is necessary to avail of the reward. NOTE: Please note, members may receive the reward amount in their wallet with a difference of 1 or 2 days, due to global time difference. Please wait two days before approaching the Plugin team for your reward queries.

**What is the reward structure for the nodes?**

- The monthly reward for a minimum staking of 2,000 PLI tokens will remain at 10%;

- For any top-up staked between 2,001 to 10,000 PLI tokens, the monthly reward will be 5%;

- For the top-up from 10,001 to 20,000 PLI tokens, the monthly reward will be 2.5%.


**What is the penalty for downtime of the node?**

- Standby Nodes Inactivity for 1 to 2 days: No penalties will be incurred.

- Standby Nodes Inactivity for 3 to 31 days: Penalties will be calculated as the total monthly reward minus (the number of inactive days multiplied by the per-day incentive).

- Penalty : Rewards that gets generated will be adjusted


**What is the penalty for downtime for a Validator Node?**

- Validator Nodes are expected to be operational 24/7. Even a one-hour downtime will result in a reduction of the per-day incentive.

- Penalties will be calculated as the total monthly reward minus (number of inactive days multiplied by the per-day incentive).


**What happens to my rewards when I unstake, rebuild my node, and restake?**

During this process, if your node address changes, your rewards are calculated afresh from the date of your new node staking. And, if your node address is not changed and remains the same as the old address, then there is no impact on your rewards. Important Note: If a member has a staking reward day on the 15th day of each month and if the member unstakes on the 10th day and does rebuild, restake, etc., then the reward on the 15th will not be given, instead the reward will be calculated from 10th day onwards. So you might be missing 25 days reward.

So, please plan your unstaking, rebuilding, and restaking process immediately after your reward day.

1\. Locking Tokens (User A)

\- Action: User A locks 100 PLI tokens in the XDC Network.

2\. Minting Tokens (User A)

\- Outcome: User A receives 100 PLI tokens minted in the Polygon Network.

3\. Spending Tokens (User A)

\- Transaction: User A spends 10 PLI as an Oracle fee in the Polygon Network.

4\. Burning Tokens (User A)

\- Action: User A can now burn only 90 PLI tokens in Polygon to unlock their 90 PLI tokens in the XDC Network.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/multichain/pliswap-how-to-instructions\#note)    NOTE

- Only Metamask wallet is currently supported; ensure your Testnet for XDC & Polygon is enabled in Metamask.

- Our development team is actively working on adding support for other wallets and networks as we expand our capabilities.

- This document is subject to change based on future network onboarding.

## Restaking Model Overview
> **As part of the ongoing transition of Plugin from version 1.0 to 2.0, Plugin governance committee after a thorough assessment has decided to discontinue Re-staking and Top-ups to the staking.**

Plugin’s Restaking model offers our node members an easy-to-use interface, where node operators can verify their stakes and restake the tokens.

This feature is to automate the staking process, with one click the restaking will be enabled and the restaking of tokens will become automated and members can earn rewards for the same without much hassle.

The main objective of this feature is to increase user flexibility and transparency. To enable Rewards or Restaking we have added a new toggle button on the Dashboard, and in one click you will be able to enable restaking for all your nodes. A chart will be displayed on the Dashboard showing the currently available tokens for top-up and Restake. Once Restake is enabled the tokens will be locked for one year and the user will receive the rewards for the restaked tokens.

Restaking can be activated only for active nodes. If a member has 4 active nodes, once restaking is enabled then the model will be activated for all 4 nodes.

Once Restaking is activated, Restake will happen automatically once the rewards for stake reach 1000 tokens on the specific node (if the total staked tokens on the node is greater than 10,000).

If the total staked tokens are less than 10,000 but restaking is enabled, then the rewards will be top-up to the tokens until it crosses 10,000 total staked tokens.

The rewards for staking will be restaked and the rewards for restaking the tokens will be sent to their respective wallets.

## Bridge Creation Guide
You can add external adapters to a Plugin node by creating a bridge in the Node Operators Interface. Each bridge must have a unique name and a URL for the external adapter. If a job has a Bridge Task, the node searches for a bridge by its name and uses that bridge as your external adapter. Remember, Bridge names are case-insensitive.

To create a bridge on the node, go to the **Create Bridge** tab in the Node Operators Interface. Specify a name for the bridge, and the URL for your external adapter, and optionally specify the minimum contract payment and number of confirmations for the bridge.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252F1JBgp8USDmvM1u12imqv%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfba28b34-83f9-4edc-878e-649312c410ba&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=79c01eb0&sv=2)

**Bridge Name** \- Must be unique to your plugin node and it is user-defined. For instance, if your external adapter brings your temperature value. Name it as "Temperature" so you can easily refer back to what the bridge does

**Bridge URL** \- It should be the URL where the external adapter is running. Mostly try to set this up in your server where the Plugin node is running.

**Minimum Contract Payment**\- This is a fee paid in PLI for the Plugin node making a call to the external adapter via the bridge. This fee is in addition to the fee specified at the global node level for processing job requests.

**Confirmation** \- Can be kept as 0

_**For example -**_

Note: If the external adapter is running on the same server as your plugin node. Keeping it as localhost.

## Fund Your Node
### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/fund-your-node\#how-to-fund-your-node)    How to fund your node

- Login into your Plugin GUI by http://<remote ip / localhost>:6688

- Go to Key section


![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252Fso1QkrtQqxsMv6qNpp7g%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd94808c3-998c-44d1-8ca2-450eccf3a905&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=802973cd&sv=2)

- Grab "address" from "Account Address" of Type "Regular"


![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FaHucZ4koHj7Y3Kdnwuvw%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dbcb60c24-701f-4003-ad0f-db0d7ecd1363&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=2ebc6fa4&sv=2)

- Go to XDCPay or MetaMask where you have XDC / PLI and transfer some funds.


**It is not necessary to dump all the funds here. 10 XDC & 5PLI should be fine to start with.**

**Also, this is not staking!.. It is just to allow your plugin node to process the transaction if any, comes your way.**

**Be cautious to fund your Node address only with the required Tokens for testing (1 to 5PLI max) DO NOT FUND MORE THAN THIS!**

**The user or the Plugin Team will not be able to withdraw any tokens that have been purposefully or mistakenly transferred to a Node address.**

After transferring the funds, you should be able to see it in the PLUGIN GUI like this

## VRF Subscription Management
In the Plugin ecosystem, VRF requests are financed through subscription accounts. These accounts serve as a centralized source of funding for your VRF requests, eliminating the need to provide funding each time your application requests randomness. By using the Subscription Manager, you can create an account and pre-pay for VRF services.

Plugin VRF subscription manager allows you to subscribe to the VRF services.

Subscription Parameters:

- Subscription ID: A distinct identification number, typically a 64-bit unsigned integer.

- Subscription accounts: Accounts that hold PLI tokens to support requests made to Plugin VRF coordinator contract.

- Subscription owner: The wallet address responsible for creating and overseeing a subscription account. Only the owner has the authority to add approved consuming contracts or withdraw funds.

- Consumers: Contracts that have been granted permission to utilize funds from the subscription account.

- Subscription balance: The quantity of PLI tokens maintained within the subscription account. Requests from consuming contracts will be supported as long as there are sufficient funds in the balance. It's essential to maintain an adequate balance to ensure the smooth operation of your applications.

- Gas price: The fluctuating cost of gas determined by network conditions.

- Callback gas: Gas used for the callback request returning requested random values.

- Verification gas: Gas used to verify randomness on-chain.

- Gas lane: The maximum gas price in wei you're willing to pay, set by keyHash in your request. These limits manage gas price spikes.

- Callback gas limit: Maximum gas allowance for the callback request, set by callbackGasLimit in your request.

## External Initiators Overview
If you are following ["Modular Deployment"](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-installations/how-to-install-plugin-node/modular-method-deployment-recommended-approach) approach for node installation, you can skip this EI setup, since it is covered in the Modular deployment script itself.

External initiators can listen to event and run for any webhook job that it has been linked to, so it is highly critical unit for Node to bridge with External-initiator and it can listen to events from client contract that uses the oracle.

External initiators allow jobs in a node to be initiated depending on some external condition. The ability to create and add external initiators to Plugin nodes enables blockchain agnostic cross-chain compatibility.

External initiators are disabled on nodes by default. Set the `FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true` configuration variable to enable this feature.

Initiator Bridges handle the authentication to and from the External Initiator and where to send the messages. When creating a Bridge two parameters are required:

Only the webhook job type can be initiated using an External Initiator.

The external initiator must be created before the webhook job, and must be referenced by name (whitelisted) in order for that external initiator to be allowed to trigger the given webhook job.

When the External Initiator is created it generates two pairs of credentials: Outgoing and Incoming. The Outgoing Access Key and Secret are used to authenticate messages sent from the Core to the External Initiator. The Incoming Access Key and Secret are used to authenticate messages sent from the External Initiator to the Core.

Then, once you've created the name, bridge, and have the correct access keys for the URL, you can proceed to use the external initiator as if it's a regular initiator in future job specs.

## Add More Stake
Currently, a total of 10,000 PLI is the maximum stake one node can have.

**Step 1:** Make sure, your node is active and the minimum staking amount is staked which is 2000 PLI

**Step 2:** Go to the "My Nodes" Section, scroll right to your node and you should see the "Additional Stake" option

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252Fhofw98ShsToUvJvt9YC7%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D36542d3f-6cd8-4618-877a-b619f61160bb&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=410506f1&sv=2)

**Step 3:** Click the "Add Now" button and you will be taken to the below page

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252F4TZyIPWqBJ304Z2YjBVx%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D680b2169-e268-4929-b6c6-efb416b743e1&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4f3e177c&sv=2)

Let's see what it has and how to read

- Initial Stake indicates, total PLI that you have staked already for this node

- Top-up Stake indicates, how much you have added as additional stake

- Total Stake indicates - Summation of "Initial Stake + Top-up Stake"

- Stake allowed to Top-up indicates - how much additional PLI you can top-up, here it is 2000

- Enter the Token to Stake - Here you have to feed the number of tokens you want to stake as a top-up.



- This number cannot be greater than "Stake allowed to Top-up".

- This number cannot be in decimal or fractional.

- This number cannot be in -ve.


**Step 4** \- Put the number of tokens you want to stake like below and click "Save Changes"

**Step 7** \- After, a successful transaction you should see a page like below

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FuXnTyRomK9AgA1RW6cXm%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D511ad40b-1d04-4dfd-96cd-ec222f73f748&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=d22af0bf&sv=2)

**"Total Stake" should sum up, the top-up value + initial stake --> here it is 4000 and the user cannot add more top-up.**

**Step 8 -** It will also display in the dashboard, here (Staked by user -> 3000)

Note - This user is a Bounty winner(50%), and he had a stake of 1000 initially & now after top-up (2000), it is summed up to 3000 PLI

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FAZoqWm2ZGgQfj7Tm02Xo%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Df2260502-71cb-4d6d-a367-3127b3317d04&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=18e3edc3&sv=2)

For 90% Bounty winner, it will be 2200 PLI - after top-up

For Non-Bounty winner, it will be 4000 PLI - after top-up

Step 1 - Copy your transaction and explore in -- > [https://explorer.xinfin.network](https://explorer.xinfin.network/)

Step 2 - Copy the contract address and paste that address in "At address"

Step 3 - Once the address is pasted, click "At Address" and you should be able to see the contract instance below

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/tips-and-tricks/open-issues\#id-1.-hardhat-upgradeable-proxy-support-for-xdc)    1\. Hardhat: Upgradeable Proxy support for XDC

Unable to set up an upgradeable proxy contract using Hardhat features. The setup is working fine with another EVM-compatible blockchain.

Can we look into this?

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252F5yZIlohWMAQ0sTjWGPov%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da85b1d49-06c8-41c6-9402-d78981ff356e&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=a3084104&sv=2)

How to replicate this issue?

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  //   const gas = await ethers.provider.getGasPrice();
  const CLCStakePool = await ethers.getContractFactory("CLCStakePool");
  console.log("Deploying stakePool...");
  const v1contract = await upgrades.deployProxy(CLCStakePool,[]);
  await v1contract.waitForDeployment();
  console.log("Contract deployed to:", await v1contract.getAddress());
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

Use this deployment script, and replace the contract with your own contract.

Expected results: it should deploy the contract fine and provide the contract address

Actual Results: Erroring out with "ProviderError: too many arguments, want at most 1"

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/tips-and-tricks/open-issues\#id-2.-headtracker-is-not-capturing-a-few-blocks-in-apothem-mainnet)    2\. HeadTracker is not capturing a few blocks in Apothem / Mainnet

We have been witnessing this issue recently, when we setup Plugin2.0.

These issues have not occurred before, but recently. To check the issues, we have executed the Plugin2.0 in "Polygon" and also in "XDC Mainnet". Logs for both executions is captured below.

Actual issue?

- In Plugin, when we configure more than 4 jobs, the execution is failed resulting in the following error


> 2023-09-25T12:48:34.707+0530 \[ERROR\] Error in new head subscription, unsubscribed headtracker/head\_listener.go:67 err=websocket: close 1000 (normal) evmChainID=50 logger=EVM.HeadTracker.HeadListener stacktrace=github.com/GoPlugin/pluginV2/core/chains/evm/headtracker.(\*headListener).ListenForNewHeads

When we execute the same against the "Polygon" chain, it runs without any issues.

Logs:-

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FBoB9mlsf86qaNuqUugCC%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7b07403c-ee7d-4c71-8390-d4fe8734d4ee&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=3bdf92e&sv=2)

The log shows that "headtracker is missing" a block, due to which we face "RPC node is not reachable" and it is on & off and unstable.

Head & Block logs for Polygon: [https://notepad.pw/g50JXvp3RIn1PNfe2Tea](https://notepad.pw/g50JXvp3RIn1PNfe2Tea)

For XDC: [https://notepad.pw/o7VtAjvuS4dFtN0YdLyd](https://notepad.pw/o7VtAjvuS4dFtN0YdLyd)

You may see the difference in the XDC Log, where the blocks are missing.

Note: We have tested the available RPC from " [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/)" for Apothem & Mainnet and the results are the same.

Let us know if you need some more information to debug.

Kindly review and let us know the possible solutions.

## Plugin Data Feed Benefits
**BENEFITS TO NODE OPERATORS:**

- Be a "recognized" Validator" in the Plugin ecosystem.

- Though it is minimal to start with, earnings through this validator node will be an additional revenue stream.



- For an instance, 1000 hits will make it to 1000\*0.01 = 10 PLI (assuming 0.01 is an oracle fee set by you).


- More the Index Pair you set, the better the hit rate from defi applications.

- Better response rate, will earn you a "Super Node Badge" from Plugin which in turn will draw the attention of the data feed users to pick your index pair.


Note : Whenever any end consumer consumes data from a specific node with the help of the deployed Internal contract address, a transaction fee (setup by node operators ~0.1 PLI) will be transferred from the consumer to the Node operator’s oracle contract. The token from the oracle contract can then be withdrawn to the respective wallet.

**BENEFITS TO DATA FEED USERS:**

- The User Interface is fast and easy to work on.

- The Data Feed charge is pocket friendly and very affordable in competition to other data feed providers.

- The data feed users will have the liberty to choose.

- Here you will have multiple options to choose from, be it sources or be it currency exchange and also a wide variety of data feeds in the Plugin data feed library.

- There are more than 1 source for some currency exchange, and the best thing is that it is visible on the data feed as well. That implies full transparency.

- The users can place their request on “ [https://feeds.goplugin.co/](https://feeds.goplugin.co/)” if a particular data is not found in the data feed list.

- The data we provide is real-time information provided by our data feed operators who are chosen after a strict procedure to ensure high-quality data.

- The feeds are strictly monitored, so there are no discrepancies in the result.


**BENEFITS TO DATA FEED PROVIDERS:**

- Consumption of your API services will be very high and the product of that will be an increase in earnings.

- There will be a huge flow of traffic toward your API.

- Data feed providers will be sharing their high-quality data with smart contract developers and applications.

- The reach of your data will be immense and will only go upward.

- Data feed providers will also get the opportunity to customise API calls on user demands.

- Providers will have the ability to provide different data as per the user’s request and even make additions in case the service isn’t available, which in turn will help your service to grow.

- Easily integrate the API into our Plugin Ecosystem.

## Decentralized Oracle Solutions
## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-2.0-validators/introduction\#introduction)    Introduction

Decentralized Oracle Platform provides cost-effective solutions to any smart contract that runs on the XDC Network Eco System.

Plugin enables the smart contract to connect with the real-time world and the data that it receives from the data feed provider is trustable by maintaining a high degree of security. Off-chain computation it does takes care of receiving a feed from multiple providers and aggregates the same.

## Withdraw Staked PLI
Withdrawal of "staked PLI" is not allowed _**within a year of staking**_. Only node operators with high reputation can request for un-stake or early release. In other cases of emergency for the Node Operator, the Governance Committee will take a considerate decision on receipt of the request.

- In this case, a strong justification is required to send via EMAIL to "Support@goplugin.co"

- After the review & approval, the node will be unlocked from the "Plugin Governance Committee"

- User can view the "withdraw option" in their staking module like below.

## Plugin 1.0 Installation Guide
## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/how-to-install-plugin-1.0-node\#system-requirements)    System Requirements

**At present, in accordance with the Governance Committee's decision, we are not accepting any new nodes. To remain informed about the most recent Plugin advancements, kindly watch out for announcements on Discord.**

Operating System - Ubuntu / Linux Kernel Version 20.04

RAM - 2GB (Minimum) - More the better
For better performance of the node, please use RAM of 5GB

Storage Space - 50 GB

Cloud hosting is better to provide high availability and good reputation

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/how-to-install-plugin-1.0-node\#how-easy-the-installation-is)    How easy the installation is?

We are recommending Ubuntu OS to have quick & easy installation

Setting up the Plugin node requires good technical expertise, but we are trying to minimize the effort by heavy lifting them through three modes of installation.

- Modular Method for Deployment(Recommended Approach)



- If you are following this approach, then "you are not required to follow "Enabling HTTPS Connections" separately. This approach takes care of https setup.


- Script Method

- Docker Method


The results of these methods is the same, but they work differently. The modular approach gives you complete flexibility and is recommended.

Choose the one you find easy, depending on your expertise, and start setting up your own nodes.

**Be cautious to fund your Node address only with the required Tokens for testing (1 to 5PLI max) DO NOT FUND MORE THAN THIS!**

**The user or the Plugin Team will not be able to withdraw any tokens that have been purposefully or mistakenly transferred to a Node address.**

**Important Note For Node Operators**

1) Node operators are required to independently set up and maintain their nodes, possessing the essential debugging skills to ensure 24/7 functionality. This practice contributes to the stability and health of our Oracle Network in the long run. Kindly review our setup documentation and follow the provided instructions."

2) It is crucial for node operators to safeguard their 'wallet address' (Seed Phrase). In the event of loss, 'The Plugin Team' cannot provide support, as the responsibility for securing and protecting wallet seed phrases lies with each individual node operator. It's important to highlight that we are in decentralized environment, where each wallet seed phrase is unique to the individual.

## Setup External Initiators
Initiate the initiators using Plugin

Step 1 - Go to terminal and login using "plugin admin login"

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
plugin admin login
```

use the credential (email id & password) set during plugin node installation

Step 2 - Create

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
plugin initiators create <NAME> <URL>
```

`NAME`: The name you want to use for your external initiator. **(You now can use** `xdc` **as an initiator in your jobspec.)** `URL`: The URL of your jobs endpoint. ie: ` http://localhost:8080/jobs`

This will give you the environment variables you need to run your external initiator. Copy the output. It will look something like this:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
║ xdc  ║ http://localhost:8080/jobs ║ b4846e85727e46b48889c6e28b555696 ║ enNfNhiiCTm1o6l+hGJVfCtRSSuDfZbj1VO4BkZG3E+b96lminE7yQHj2KALMAIk ║ jWt64+Q9benOf5JuGwJtQnbByN9rtHwSlElOVpHVTvGTP5Zb2Guwzy6w3wflwyYt ║ 46m38YkeCymYU0kr4Yg6x3e98CyAu+37y2+kMO2AL9lRMjA3hRA1ejFdG9UfFCAE
```

Create a `startEI.sh` file in the `external-initiator` folder with the following contents:

Be sure to save these values, since the secrets cannot be shown again.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
export EI_DATABASEURL=postgresql://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$SERVER:$PORT/$DATABASE
export EI_CHAINLINKURL=http://localhost:6688

## Requesting Random Values
The deployed contract sends requests for random values to Plugin VRF, acquires those values, constructs a struct RequestStatus, and stores it within mapping s\_requests.

1. Navigate back to Remix and review the available functions of your deployed contract listed under Deployed Contracts.

2. Execute the requestRandomWords() function on your contract to trigger the request. MetaMask prompts confirmation of the transaction. Upon approval, Plugin VRF processes your request, fulfills it, and returns the random values to your contract via a callback to the fulfillRandomWords() function. Subsequently, a new key requestId is appended to the mapping s\_requests.


Given the prevailing conditions of the testnet, anticipate a brief interval before the callback delivers the requested random values to your contract.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/use-cases/crypto-compare-pricing-index\#steps-to-be-accomplished)    _Steps to be accomplished:_

1) Go to Remix and open the `Oracle.sol` smart contract. The contents of this file will be very minimal. pragma solidity 0.4.24;

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
pragma solidity 0.4.24;
import "@goplugin/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol";
```

2) On the **Compile** tab, click the **Compile** button for `Oracle.sol`. Remix automatically selects the compiler version and language from the `pragma` line unless you select a specific version manually.

3) On the **Deploy and Run** tab, configure the following settings:

- Select "Injected Web3" as your **Environment**. The JavaScript VM environment cannot access your oracle node.

- Select the "Oracle" contract from the **Contract** menu.

- Copy the PLI token contract address for the network(like Mainnet, Apothem as given below) you are using and paste it into the `address_link` field next to the **Deploy** button:

For the demo purpose, we will setup our external adapter to pull the data from cryptocompare API. Follow along this tutorial to understand how this works

Setting up external initiator requires following steps to be performed

- Git clone the repository

- cd & npm install

- Include the API endpoint & Parse the payload

- Run the server


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/use-cases/crypto-compare-pricing-index\#steps-to-be-accomplished-2)    Steps to be accomplished:

Step 1 -

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/use-cases/crypto-compare-pricing-index\#requesting-data)    Requesting Data

When an external adapter receives a request from the Plugin node, the JSON payload will include the following objects:

- `data` (Guaranteed to be present but may be empty)

- `meta` (Optional, depends on job type)

- `responseURL` (Optional, will be supplied if job supports asynchronous callbacks)

- `id` (Optional, can be nice to use for EA logging to help debug job runs)


**Returning Data**

When the external adapter wants to return data immediately, it must include `data` in the returned JSON.

An example of the response data can look like:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
  data: {
    result: '0.07261'
  }
}
```

Note - the external adapter that you are running, should be the same URL endpoint mapped in Bridge.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
const { Requester, Validator } = require('@goplugin/external-adapter')
require("dotenv").config();

const customError = (data) => {
  if (data.Response === 'Error') return true
  return false
}

const customParams = {
  endpoint: ['endpoint']
}

const createRequest = (input, callback) => {

  const url = `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemulti?fsyms=${input.data.fromsystem}&tsyms=${input.data.tosystem}`

  const config = {
    url
  }

  if (process.env.API_KEY) {
    config.headers = {
      "api_key": process.env.API_KEY
    }
  }
  Requester.request(config, customError)
    .then(response => {

      //console.log("response value is ",response.data[input.data.fromsystem][input.data.tosystem]);

      const res = {
        data: {
          "result": response.data[input.data.fromsystem][input.data.tosystem].toString()
        }
      }
      callback(response.status, Requester.success(input.id, res));
    })
    .catch(error => {
      callback(500, Requester.errored(input.id, error))
    })
}

module.exports.createRequest = createRequest
```

Let's see what's in " **index**. **js**"

- We are importing 'external-adapter' from goplugin npm repo and importing two methods such as Requester, Validator.

- Importing "dotenv" module to access the .env file for sensitive info (API\_KEY)

- "customError" is a function to return either true or false if error occurs

- "customParams" is a variable to declare custom parameters to pass on in URL - this can be customized accordingly

- "createRequest" is the method actually doing heavy lifting.



- URL is getting defined, since for cryptocompare node the endpoint is getting passed via smart contract the source & destination token is accessed via "input.data.fromsystem","input.data.tosystem"

- Next, we are checking API _KEY if exists in .env parm, else it will not be applied.. For authenticated API, you have to pass API_ KEY

- Requester.request will scan for the payload from API endpoint and customized the output. In this example, we are checking "input.data.fromsystem","input.data.tosystem"


When you run PM2 start server.js, the server will by default run in port 5002 and just make sure the bridge is correctly pointed out to this port number.. For instance, this should be http://localhost:5002/

**Define Bridge**

You can add external adapters to a Plugin node by creating a bridge in the Node Operators Interface. Each bridge must have a unique name and a URL for the external adapter. If a job has a Bridge Task, the node searches for a bridge by name and uses that bridge as your external adapter. Bridge names are case insensitive.

To create a bridge on the node, go to the **Create Bridge** tab in the Node Operators Interface. Specify a name for the bridge, the URL for your external adapter, and optionally specify the minimum contract payment and number of confirmations for the bridge.

**Bridge Name** \- Must be unique to your plugin node and it is user defined. For instance, if your external-adapter brings your temperature value. Name it as "Temperature" so you can easily refer back what does the bridge does

**Bridge URL** \- It should be the URL where the external-adapter is running. Mostly try to set this up in your server where plugin node is running.

**Minimum Contract Payment**\- Is a fee paid in PLI for the Plugin node making a call to the external adapter via the bridge. This fee is in addition to the fee specified at the global node level for processing job requests.

**Confirmation** \- Can be kept as 0.

Note : If external-adapter is running in same server as your plugin node. Keeping the 'Bridge URL' as 'http://localhost:5002'.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/use-cases/crypto-compare-pricing-index\#step5-create-a-job)    **Step5 - Create a Job**

**Add Bridge to Job Spec**

Bridge is an another task, which takes the control to external-adapter and perform the defined requirements and give back the results to the task services..

For instance, this job spec has set of task

- cryptocompare(This is the name of your bridge which you set up)

- copy

- multiply

- ethuin256

- EthTx


For most of the job spec's, we ge the Multiply, ethUin256 & etHTX in place. But the other two(cryptocompare, copy) will be changed job to job.

in this example, the task is to call the bridge which is cryptocompare, then cryptocompare will in turn call the server(which runs exernal-adapter in http://localhost:5000/ endpoint) and bring the results.

Next task, will copy the data from the payload and send it to next task which is "multiply".

Multiply then remove the fractions by multiplying with the value given in the contract and ethuin256 task will convert the results into blockchain understandable format.

Finally, ethTx task will write the data onto blockchain.

NOTE: Change oracle\_address in below mentioned JSON to your Orace address generated as the result of executing Oracle.sol in the beginning.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
   "initiators": [{\
	"type": "external",\
	"params": {\
		"name": "xdc",\
		"body": {\
			"endpoint": "xinfin-mainnet",\
			"addresses": ["oracle_address"]\
			}\
	}\
     }],
     "tasks":
         [   {\
	     "type": "cryptocompare"\
	     },\
	     {\
	     "type": "copy",\
		 "params": {\
		    "copyPath": [\
			"result"\
			]\
		 }\
	     },\
	     {\
		"type": "multiply"\
	     },\
	     {\
		"type": "ethuint256"\
	     },\
	     {\
		"type": "EthTx"\
	     }\
	 ]
}
```

Similarly, bridge can perform any tasks and bring the value to prescribed format. Implementing the external-adapter - custom logic is with user.

## PLI Yield Farming FAQ
This Page gives the Freqently Asked Questions and it's clarifications with respect to YieldFarming.

1. **Can I continue Yield farming for one more term?** Plugin Yield farming cannot be continued after 365 days, from the date of your each deposit.

2. **When can I withdraw my tokens from "PLI Yield Farming"?**
At the end of 365 days from the date of deposit, members will be eligible for unstaking and withdrawal.

3. **Can I withdraw all my tokens after an year?**
Yes, you can withdraw all your tokens which has completed one year of holding period from the date of deposit in Yield farming contract.

4. **What happens when my tokens are unstaked and retained in the contract?** Once the tokens are 'Unstaked' it is the responsibility of the member to withdraw the tokens. When the tokens are unstaked and not withdrawn, depositors will not get rewards for holding their tokens in Plugin's contract.

5. **Will I get my PLI back, if I lost my wallet access through which I registered and deposited in Yield Farming?** It is the primary responsibility of the member to have access to his/her wallet. If the member lost access to his/her wallet address, then the staked tokens remain in the contract address and nobody can access those tokens.

## Restaking Model Steps
Here are the steps you need to know, to enable the restaking model for your node.

- To Enabled Restaking, a toggle button is created on the dashboard to enable the restaking model for all your active nodes.


![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FLPmcEpgrrbUvWFXqhGgW%252Fimg1.jpg%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D3d79d0bd-1825-4698-83b0-b8b7a6771233&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=df84f8d9&sv=2)

Note - If restaking is not enabled, then the rewards will be sent to your wallet and won’t be restaked.

- Once Restaking is selected then the rewards will not be sent to the wallet but instead added to Restaking / Top-up and you will receive the rewards for those restaked tokens.

- In case you activated Restaking, but the total staking on your node is less than the maximum stake of 20,000 then the Rewards will be added as a top-up stake and you can check the details on the Stake Menu.

- Once the total of Top-up stake rewards crosses 500 tokens, then the status will be updated to “Yet to Stake “ followed by which the Governance Committee will stake the tokens on your behalf. And once this is done, the status will get updated to “Stake”

- A chart specific to each node with a restaking ID will appear on the Dashboard showing the currently available tokens for top-up and restake.

- Once the total staking on the Node reaches the maximum stake of 20,000 then the Rewards will be added to the Restaking and can be checked on the Restake Menu.

- Once activated restaking will happen automatically once the top-up rewards reach 1000 tokens (If the total staked tokens on a node are greater than 20,000).

- As you can see in the above image, the user will be able to view the automated Restake by us on their behalf, the already staked tokens, and the tokens that are yet to be restaked.

- The yet-to-stake tokens are the rewards for the re-stake that get accumulated until they reach 1000 tokens, after which those 1000 tokens will also be added to the “Total Restake”.

## Oracle Contract Deployment
Using the Oracle contract, you can use your own node to fulfill requests. This guide will show you how to deploy your own Oracle contract and add jobs to your node so that it can provide data to smart contracts.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/oracle-plugin-1.0-deprecated/deployment\#requirements)    Requirements

Before you begin this guide, complete the following tasks to make sure you have all of the tools that you need:

- Set up XDCPay and obtain Apothem(Testnet) PLI.

- Configure a Xinfin client with an active WebSocket connection.

- Run a Plugin Node and connect it to a supported database.

- Fund the XDC Wallet address that your Plugin node uses. You can find the address in the node Operator GUI under the **Keys** tab. The address of the node is the `Regular` type. You can obtain test ETH from several faucets.


### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/oracle-plugin-1.0-deprecated/deployment\#address-types)    Address Types

Your node works with several different types of addresses. Each address type has a specific function:

- **Node address:** This is the address for your Plugin node wallet. The node requires native blockchain tokens at all times to respond to requests. For this example, the node uses XDC. When you start a Plugin node, it automatically generates this address. You can find this address on the Node Operator GUI under Keys > Account addresses.

- **Oracle contract address:** This is the address for contracts like `Operator.sol` or `Oracle.sol` that are deployed to a blockchain. Do not fund these addresses with native blockchain tokens such as XDC. When you make API call requests, the funds pass through this contract to interact with your Plugin node. This will be the address that smart contract developers point to when they choose a node for an API call.

- **Admin wallet address:** This is the address that owns your `Operator.sol` or `Oracle.sol` contract addresses. If you're on OCR, this is the wallet address that receives PLI tokens.


### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/oracle-plugin-1.0-deprecated/deployment\#deploy-your-own-oracle-contract)    Deploy your own Oracle contract

1. Go to Remix and open the `Oracle.sol` smart contract. The contents of this file will be very minimal.


Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
pragma solidity 0.4.24;
import "@goplugin/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol";
```

1. On the **Compile** tab, click the **Compile** button for `Oracle.sol`. Remix automatically selects the compiler version and language from the `pragma` line unless you select a specific version manually.

2. On the **Deploy and Run** tab, configure the following settings:



- Select "Injected Web3" as your **Environment**. The JavaScript VM environment cannot access your oracle node.

- Select the "Oracle" contract from the **Contract** menu.

- Copy the PLI token contract address for the network(like Mainnet, Apothem as given below) you are using and paste it into the `address_link` field next to the **Deploy** button:


MainnetApothem

Compile the program and you should see "green tick"

Click **Deploy**. XDCPay prompts you to confirm the transaction.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FpPLqC4jUtmnCeiBrkTAN%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da5f002fb-3053-4088-bc5e-959b1a49e50c&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=fa174b94&sv=2)

If the transaction is successful, a new address displays in the **Deployed Contracts** section. Keep a note of the Oracle contract address(let's remember this address as **OCA** to refer to). You need it later for your contract consumption.

Last updated 3 years ago

## Job Setup Guide
**Let’s create a JOB, so you can test and see if your oracle is getting interacted with the external world**

Create an Alarm Job in the Plugin node.

Steps to create Alarm Job -

- Login to the Plugin node

- Navigate to Jobs and click on New Job

- Copy the job specification mentioned below

- Paste the contents into the Json Spec field and create the job

- Copy the newly created job ID which we will be using later

- Submit clientcontract using [xinfin.remix](https://remix.xinfin.network/), if any error occurs then you can use [remix.ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org/)


**NOTE:**

1) While filling up "name", and "endpoint" values, please provide the same Name value which you used for 'plugin initiators create <Name>'.

2) For the 'addresses' values you need to paste the OCA which we used in [Deployment](https://docs.goplugin.co/oracle/deployment). You need to remove the 'xdc' at the start of the OCA and replace it with '0x', and make sure there is no space left at the front or back of the OCA.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
    "initiators":[\
        {\
            "type":"external",\
            "params":{\
      "name": "xdc",\
               "body": {\
      "endpoint": "xdc",\
      "addresses": ["0xf180e56bb575806aefaf2a7616622a9fc180b51c"]\
    }\
            }\
        }\
    ],
    "tasks":[\
        {\
            "type":"sleep",\
            "confirmations":null,\
            "params":{\
            }\
        },\
        {\
            "type":"ethbool",\
            "confirmations":null,\
            "params":{\
            }\
        },\
        {\
            "type":"ethtx",\
            "confirmations":null,\
            "params":{\
            }\
        }\
    ],
    "startAt":null,
    "endAt":null
}
```

Here, “Sleep”, “ethbool”, “ethtx” are core-adapters,

Core adapters are the built-in functionality that every Plugin node supports. Strung together, they act as tasks that need to be performed to complete a Job. Adapters that are prefixed with “Eth” refer to tasks that post data onto the chain.

## Withdraw PLI from Node
Whenever you set up a plugin node, a dedicated wallet will be generated and it is unique to that plugin node address. It is necessary to sufficiently fund your Plugin node with XDC for the transaction fee & PLI for the oracle fee.

So what if you want to withdraw a portion of this to your wallet?

Step 1) Every plugin node generates the unique wallet and generates the private key in the database.

Step 2) You can find the “private key’” for your wallet in the “Keys” table in Postgres

Step 3) With a sudo user, you can view the json value in the table

Step 4) Copy down the json into a json file(let’s say — Test.json)

Step 5) Import this json into metamask to view your XDC / PLI balance

## Node Reputation Overview
The HIGH Reputation of a node is very critical to strengthening our Plugin Oracle Network, hence it is the prime responsibility of every node operator to periodically review their node health by ensuring high-time availability.

Plugin Node Reputation will be calculated based on the following metrics

- 24/7 Node Availability

- Keeping Plugin Node and External Initiator running all the time so as to listen to the events.

- Response time for the oracle service.

- Data Quality (If node operators act as a data feed provider)

- Data Integrity.


To start with, we are measuring 24/7 Node availability by periodically pinging the nodes and it will be once a day. So every node will go through this audit on daily basis and the stats will be captured.

Reputation will be calculated based on the number of days a node is up for a month. So monthly reputation along with cumulative reputation will be shown to the node operators.

If you see "0" in your reputation, either your node is newly approved or your node is down and not responding to our audit job.

If your node is newly approved, you can see your reputation from the very next day only. So no action is required from your end.

If your node is running for a long time and you see "0", we would suggest you should review the server and see if anything is blocking the audit job to review the metrics.

As a node operator, it is very important to keep your server healthy by periodically reviewing it and ensuring high-time availability. The Plugin Team, strongly believes that reputation will help every node operator to stay on top of their node service.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/how-a-reputation-is-calculated\#how-do-i-check-my-node-reputation)    How do I check my node reputation?

- Go to [https://oracles.goplugin.co/](https://oracles.goplugin.co/)

- Login using your credentials

- Click "My Nodes"


![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FyeDUPTMJqwcutWcaKuRb%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd1473519-3a11-4aa5-9e1e-600bf2fd0457&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=6db70e02&sv=2)

As mentioned earlier, the REPUTATION shows "0" here due to the fact, that the node is newly approved and reputation will be calculated from the very next day.

If you have any questions about your Reputation, feel free to raise a ticket from your registered Email ID via https://oracles.goplugin.co

## External Adapters Overview
When you want to perform custom computation or custom logic to bring data via specialized APIs, then an External Adapter is the way to go. It helps Plugin to enable an easy way of integrating the custom logic.

It is a service that the Plugin node communicates via its API with a simple JSON specification.

Information on external adapters is broken up into three main categories: contract creators, developers, and node operators.

- Contract Creators will need to know how to specify an external adapter in their request for external data.

- Developers will need to know how to implement an external adapter for an API.

- Node Operators will need to know how to add an external adapter to their node so that they can provide specialized services to smart contracts.


Is it necessary to implement an External Adapter?

- Yes, it is when you want to perform complex logic before the data gets written onto the smart contract.

- For ex - Let's say, you are pulling the data from the "External world" using API, and the data from the API result needs to be formatted


External Initiator defines, when and how a job will run

To set up an external adapter, the node operator need to perform these 3 steps

- Setup Bridge in the Plugin Node

- Update jobspec to have Bridge

- Setup External-Adapter server program in the same node



- Basically, this step decides what kind of services a job is provided to end users. For instance, "Index Pair (BTC/USDT), (ETH/USDT), (ETC/XDC)" etc.,

## Docker Plugin Installation
In this method, we advocate the user to install the database(PostgreSQL) in a host machine, and the containerized image is connected with the PostgreSQL in the host. So, their database will remain unaffected when the user accidentally stops the container.

The docker method of running the node is tried and tested in the below-mentioned environments.

1\. Standalone host OS: Ubuntu Linux — 20.04
2\. AWS EC2 hosted OS: Ubuntu Linux — 20.04

In environments other than those mentioned above, the setup steps may not work, we are trying to set it up in other environments, and you will hear from us on this.

Follow Phase 1 - This will help you to set up & run the Plugin node

Follow Phase 2 - This will help you set up an external initiator and set up a job.

## OCR Setup Guide
**OCR configuration, currently is specific for validators involved in participating in the Oracle price feeds.**
**We will send an announcement to validators while changing the current price feeds to OCR protocol based price feeds.**

Here are the detailed steps to enable Offchain reporting onto the Plugin Node for Peer.

1. To enable OCR in the Plugin environment, set the parameters in the `config.toml` file as shown below. Once the changes are made, restart the plugin using `pm2 restart 0`.


![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252F3nez0gQtI8sH8K6b9Uhj%252FScreenshot%25202024-06-03%2520at%25201.35.40%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9e166a63-d5a2-4542-9b4a-cea613bcb53c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=fbe67759&sv=2)

## Core Adapters Overview
Core adapters are the built-in functionality that every Plugin node supports. Strung together, they act as tasks that need to be performed to complete a Job. Adapters that are prefixed with "Eth" refer to tasks that post data onto the chain. Here are some examples of the data types that adapters convert data to.

Name

Core Adapter

Ethereum Data Type

Signed Integers

EthInt256

int256

Unsigned Integers

EthUint256

uint256

Bytes

EthBytes32

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#compare)    Compare

This core adapter compares a user-specified value with the value from the previous adapter's result.

**Parameters**

- `operator`: The operator used to compare values. You may use one of the following:



- `eq`: Equal

- `neq`: Not equal

- `gt`: Greater than

- `gte`: Greater than or equal to

- `lt`: Less than

- `lte`: Less than or equal to


- `value`: The value to check against the previous adapter's result. May be a string or a number, but if the value is a string, only `eq` and `neq` may be used.


**Solidity Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.addInt("value", 10000);
req.add("operator", "gte");
```

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#copy)    Copy

The core adapter walks the `copyPath` specified and returns the value found at that result. If returning JSON data from an external adapter, you will need to use this adapter to parse the response.

**Parameters**

- `copyPath`: Takes an array of strings, each string being the next key to parse out in the JSON object or a single dot-delimited string.


**Solidity Example**

For the JSON object:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{"RAW": {"ETH": {"USD": {"LASTMARKET": "_someValue"}}}}
```

You would use the following for an array of strings:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
string[] memory path = new string[](4);
path[0] = "RAW";
path[1] = "ETH";
path[2] = "USD";
path[3] = "LASTMARKET";
req.addStringArray("copyPath", path);
```

Or the following for a single dot-delimited string:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.add("copyPath", "RAW.ETH.USD.LASTMARKET");
```

**Job Specification Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
  "type": "Copy",
  "params": {
    "copyPath": [\
      "RAW",\
      "ETH",\
      "USD",\
      "LASTMARKET"\
    ]
  }
}
```

For arrays, you can access the path of an array by using the index. If this is your JSON:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{"endpoint": [ {"path":"value"}]}
```

You could get the `"value"` by:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.add("copyPath", "endpoint.0.path");
```

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#ethbool)    EthBool

The core adapter reads the given Boolean value and then converts it into Solidity's `bool` format.

**Parameters**

_None taken._

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#ethbytes32)    EthBytes32

The core adapter formats its input into a string and then converts it into Solidity's `bytes32` format.

**Parameters**

_None taken._

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#ethint256)    EthInt256

The core adapter formats its input into an integer and then converts it into Solidity's `int256` format.

**Parameters**

_None taken._

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#ethtx)    EthTx [![Link to this section](https://docs.chain.link/images/link.svg)](https://docs.chain.link/docs/core-adapters/\#ethtx)

The core adapter takes the input given and places it into the data field of the transaction. It then signs an Ethereum transaction and broadcasts it to the network. The task is only completed once the transaction's confirmations equal the `MIN_OUTGOING_CONFIRMATIONS` amount.

If the transaction does not confirm by the time `ETH_GAS_BUMP_THRESHOLD` number of blocks have passed since initially broadcasting, then it bumps the gas price of the transaction by `ETH_GAS_BUMP_WEI`.

**Parameters**

- `address`: The address of the Ethereum account which the transaction will be sent to.

- `functionSelector`: **(optional)** the function selector of the contract which the transaction will invoke. `functionSelector` is placed before `dataPrefix` and the adapter's input in the data field of the transaction.

- `dataPrefix`: **(optional)** data which will be prepended before the adapter's input, but after the `functionSelector` in the transaction's data field.

- `value`: **(optional)** data to send to the function, will append after the `dataPrefix` payload if it's included. Will automatically come from the previous task.


### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#ethuint256)    EthUint256 [![Link to this section](https://docs.chain.link/images/link.svg)](https://docs.chain.link/docs/core-adapters/\#ethuint256)

The core adapter formats its input into an integer and then converts it into Solidity's `uint256` format.

**Parameters**

_None taken._

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#httpget)    HttpGet

The core adapter will report the body of a successful `GET` request to the specified `get` or return an error if the response status code is greater than or equal to 400.

**Parameters**

- `get`: Takes a string containing the URL to make a `GET` request to.

- `queryParams`: Takes a string or array of strings for the URL's query parameters.

- `extPath`: Takes a slash-delimited string or array of strings to be appended to the job's URL.

- `headers`: Takes an object containing keys as strings and values as arrays of strings.


**Solidity Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.add("get", "http://example.com");
req.add("queryParams", "firstKey=firstVal&secondKey=secondVal");
req.add("extPath", "price/BTC/USD");
```

**Job Specification Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
  "type": "HttpGet",
  "params": {
    "get": "https://example.com/some-endpoint",
    "headers": {
      "X-API-Key": [\
        "abc123abc123abc123abc123"\
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For security, since the URL may come from an untrusted source, HTTPGet imposes some restrictions on which IPs may be fetched. Local network and multicast IPs are disallowed by default and attempting to connect will result in an error.

If you really must access one of these IPs, you can use the `HTTPGetWithUnrestrictedNetworkAccess` adapter instead.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#httppost)    HttpPost

The core adapter will report the body of a successful `POST` request to the specified `post`, or return an error if the response status code is greater than or equal to 400.

**Parameters**

- `post`: takes a string containing the URL to make a `POST` request to.

- `headers`: takes a object containing keys as strings and values as arrays of strings.

- `queryParams`: takes a string or array of strings for the URL's query parameters.

- `extPath`: takes a slash-delimited string or array of strings to be appended to the job's URL.

- `body`: the JSON body (as a string) that will be used as the data in the request.


**Solidity Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.add("post", "http://post.example.com");
req.add("queryParams", "firstKey=firstVal&secondKey=secondVal");
req.add("extPath", "price/BTC/USD");
```

**Job Specification Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
    "type": "HttpPost",
    "params": {
        "post": "https://example.com/some-endpoint",
        "headers": {
            "X-API-Key": [\
                "abc123abc123abc123abc123"\
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

For security, since the URL may come from an untrusted source, HTTPPost imposes some restrictions on which IPs may be fetched. Local network and multicast IPs are disallowed by default and attempting to connect will result in an error.

If you really must access one of these IPs, you can use the `HTTPPostWithUnrestrictedNetworkAccess` adapter instead.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#jsonparse)    JsonParse [![Link to this section](https://docs.chain.link/images/link.svg)](https://docs.chain.link/docs/core-adapters/\#jsonparse)

The core adapter walks the `path` specified and returns the value found at that result. If returning JSON data from the HttpGet or HttpPost adapters, you must use this adapter to parse the response.

**Parameters**

- `path`: takes an array of strings, each string being the next key to parse out in the stringified JSON result or a single dot-delimited string.


**Solidity Example**

For the stringified JSON:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{"RAW": {"ETH": {"USD": {"LASTMARKET": "_someValue"}}}}
```

You would use the following for an array of strings:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
string[] memory path = new string[](4);
path[0] = "RAW";
path[1] = "ETH";
path[2] = "USD";
path[3] = "LASTMARKET";
req.addStringArray("path", path);
```

Or the following for a single dot-delimited string:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.add("path", "RAW.ETH.USD.LASTMARKET");
```

**Job Specification Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
  "type": "JsonParse",
  "params": {
    "path": [\
      "RAW",\
      "ETH",\
      "USD",\
      "LASTMARKET"\
    ]
  }
}
```

**Parsing Arrays**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.add("path", "3.standardId");
```

The above example parses the 4th object of the following JSON response and returns 677 as a result:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
[\
   {\
     "standardId": 20,\
     "name": "ERC-20"\
   },\
   {\
     "standardId": 721,\
     "name": "ERC-721"\
   },\
   {\
     "standardId": 1155,\
     "name": "ERC-1155"\
   },\
   {\
     "standardId": 677,\
     "name": "ERC-677"\
    }\
]
```

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#multiply)    Multiply

The core adapter parses the input into a float and then multiplies it by the `times` field.

**Parameters**

- `times`: the number to multiply the input by.


**Solidity Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
run.addInt("times", 100);
```

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#noop)    NoOp

The core adapter performs no operations, simply passing the input on as output. Commonly used for testing.

**Parameters**

_None taken._

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#nooppend)    NoOpPend

The core adapter performs no operations, and marks its task run pending. Commonly used for testing.

**Parameters**

_None taken._

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#quotient)    Quotient

Quotient

The core adapter gives the result of x / y where x is a specified value (dividend) and y is the input value (result).

This can be useful for inverting outputs, e.g. if your API only offers a USD/ETH conversion rate and you want ETH/USD instead you can use this adapter with a dividend of 1 to get the inverse (i.e. 1 / result).

**Parameters**

- `dividend`: the number which is divided by the result


### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/core-adapters\#sleep)    Sleep

The core adapter will pause the current task pipeline for the given duration.

ENABLE\_EXPERIMENTAL\_ADAPTERS

You must set `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ADAPTERS=true` in order to use the sleep adapter

**Parameters**

- `until`: the UNIX timestamp of when the job should stop sleeping and resume at the next task in the pipeline.


**Solidity Example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
req.addUint("until", now + 1 hours);
```

**Job Specification example**

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]

## Withdraw PLI from Oracle
**Please be mindful that, you can withdraw PLI which has been earned by Oracle Contract but you cannot withdraw PLI from the Oracle contract when you manually send it.**

As a node operator, you are free to set up how much PLI to receive as a fee for your oracle and those Fees can be withdrawn using the oracle smart contract using the below step.

Step 1 — Go to remix ( [https://remix.xinfin.network/](https://remix.xinfin.network/) )

Step 2 — Point Environment to “Injected Web3”

Step 3 — Open your Oracle smart contract with your oracle address

Step 4 — You can see the “Withdraw” option.

- The recipient can be your wallet where you want the PLI to be transferred or withdrawn

- Amount — Number of PLI’s to be withdrawn

## Submit Node Details
Step 1 - Login onto [http://oracles.goplugin.co/](http://oracles.goplugin.co/) using your credential

Once your node is ready with the following, you should be able to submit the details to Plugin Team to review & approve the same.

- Node Address

- Oracle Contract address

- Job ID


Note, a node can have multiple job setup. Basically, job allows the end user to consume the tasks. More the jobs you setup and share with community, higher the chance to get the PLI fee

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FAhakRkhiqmYjgPsOpOJQ%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D83c488e3-3c79-4ea6-a190-a36cb2755f32&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=ff3975e5&sv=2)

Click - My Nodes -> Add Node & provide the following inputs

Following fields are required to add

- Name - Name of your node (It is user defined) - Recommendation ( Region of your server) For instance - Ohio-Server1

- Short Description - This will be displayed and visible to the public, so keep it descriptive enough so user can understand about your nodes

- Provider - Aws or Google or Azure or Vultr or other service providers - you can name it

- IP Address of the machine - Note this will not be visible to public users -- Only for admin review

- Operating System

- RAM - 4GB, 8GB, etc

- Security Patch Version - Current Version of OS & respective security patch details

- Oracle Address - "Smart Contract" which you deployed during node setup

- Node Address - "Plugin Node Address" - Regular account

- Wallet Address - XDC Wallet address



- Key input. PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE D'CENT Wallet address here. Since, after your node is approved, you are expected to do "Staking".. Only XDCPay wallet works for staking at this point.


- Network - Mainnet or Apothem (Mostly it should be Mainnet) for public use


Once you submit the node details, it will notify the "Plugin Team" for review & approval. So expect a little delay for review & approval, as the requests queue will be high.

It is very important to give correct information, or else the node will not be approved. So take time to review before you submit. If there is not enough data, your request will be "returned for modification" - which you can view in "My Nodes"

## Restaking Benefits Overview
1. Once, Restaking is enabled, the entire process becomes automated.

2. Restaked tokens will be locked for 1 year and you will receive 2.5% of the restaked tokens as monthly rewards when you cross 10k staked tokens on your node. And in case your total staked tokens are less than 10k, then you will continue to receive 10% of the staked tokens.

3. The tokens will be locked for 1 year, and if the node gets deactivated due to any issues, the member will continue to receive the rewards for restaking as it will be locked for one year.

4. Restaking once selected will be applied to all the active nodes.

5. Rewards on the restaked tokens will be provided to the member every month.

6. Each node will have an individual restaking ID and the chart with the details specific to that node will be displayed on the dashboard.

## Validator Node Rewards
**The monthly reward for a validator node:-**

The monthly reward for the staked PLI tokens is **2.5%.**

Validator Nodes are expected to be operational 24/7. Node operators are rewarded for the trustable data and any false data will be penalized through the ‘carrot and stick’ method.

**How does the rewards penalty work?**

Penalties will be calculated as the total monthly reward minus (the number of inactive days multiplied by the per-day incentive).

Even one hour of downtime will be reflected in the reduction of the per-day incentive.

To further elaborate, Firstly, the number of inactive days is calculated using multiple levels of testing on the node, and then that is multiplied by the per-day incentive. After which the value is subtracted from the monthly reward calculated for that node.

**Where can I see the number of inactive days per node on the platform?**

The number of inactive days per node can be seen on the "My Incentives" Page once you log into the Oracles Dashboard.

**What happens to my rewards when I unstake my validator node, rebuild it, and restake it. ?**

During this process, if your node address changes, your rewards are calculated afresh from the date of your new node staking. And, if your node address is not changed and remains the same as the old node's address, then there is no impact on your rewards.

Important Note: If a member has a staking reward day on the 15th day of each month and if the member unstakes on the 10th day and does rebuild, restake, etc., then the reward on the 15th will not be given, instead the reward will be calculated from the 10th day onwards. So you might be missing 25 days rewards.

## Node Management
For some reason, if you want to deactivate your nodes and re-activate it later. So to avoid reputation hit due to downtime. You can do so, through this approach

For De-activation

Step 1 - Go to "My Nodes" section

Step 2 - Click "De-activate" it will ask you a confirmation to remove from public view

For Re-activation

Step 1 - Go to "My Nodes" section

Step 2 - Click "Re-activate" it will ask you a confirmation to display for public view

Note: In this approach, only the node gets deactivate & re-activated. The staked amount will not have any impact

## Re-staking Model Scenarios
> **As part of the ongoing transition of Plugin from version 1.0 to 2.0, Plugin governance committee after a thorough assessment has decided to discontinue Re-staking and Top-ups to the staking.**

The following are examples of 2 scenarios that will help you understand the Restaking Model a little better.

- **Scenario 1:** A fully staked node (2000 stake plus 18000 top-up - 20,000 PLI Total)


If enabled, restaking happens automatically for every 1000 PLI tokens earned. The operator continues to earn 10% on the original 10,000 PLI and begins to earn 2.5% on the amount over 10,000 PLI that is restaked. The newly staked PLI is locked for one year.

- **Scenario 2:** A staked but not fully topped-up node (i.e. 2000 staked plus 4000 top-up - 6000 PLI Total)


If enabled, top-up happens automatically for every 500 PLI tokens earned. The operator will earn 10% on the original 6000 PLI and also earn 10% on the top-up amount until the node becomes fully staked at 20,000 PLI. The newly staked PLI is locked for one year. Once fully staked, the procedure in Scenario 1 becomes in force.

## Unstake Node Process
**Unstaking of the node that has completed 1 year of staking but has not opted for "re-stake" follows these steps:**

1. Log on to the dashboard and go to the "Stake" menu.

2. After selecting the "View" option, you'll notice a button labeled "Request for Unlock" if your node has been staking continuously for a year without any restaking.

3. Once the governance committee reviews your request, your node will be set to the "Unlock" status.

4. You can then withdraw the staked tokens, and the node will be deactivated.


**For members who do not meet the criteria mentioned above, the process remains unchanged**

1. Raise a ticket/query with the Plugin Team, including the node's IP Address and stake ID, along with the reason for unstaking.

2. After the team verifies the request, it will be presented to our Governance Committee for approval.

3. Once approved, the node will be "Unlocked," allowing members to withdraw their tokens.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
sudo pg_ctlcluster 12 main restart
sudo docker exec -it <container_ID> /bin/bash -c ". ~/.profile && pm2 start /pluginAdm/startNode.sh"
```

For instance

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
sudo docker exec -it 59961fcd0f4f /bin/bash -c ". ~/.profile && pm2 start /pluginAdm/startNode.sh"
```

Your node will start with status as ‘online’.

If you want to probe your running node, then you can use the command format given below.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
sudo docker exec -it <container_ID> /bin/bash -c ". ~/.profile && <YOUR_COMMAND>"

## Random Values Subscription Guide
This guide elucidates the process of obtaining random values utilizing a straightforward contract to solicit and obtain random values from Plugin VRF Subscription Model.

This instructional assumes familiarity with the creation and deployment of smart contracts on the Xinfin Apothem Network utilizing the subsequent tools:

- The Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

- MetaMask

- Xinfin Network


To commence, create a fresh subscription on the Xinfin Apothem Network.

1. Launch MetaMask and set it to operate on the Xinfin Apothem Network. The Subscription Manager automatically detects your network based on the active MetaMask network.

2. Validate on MetaMask the presence of Apothem XDC and PLI on XDC Apothem. Testnet XDC and PLI can be acquired at the respective links: [faucet.apothem.network](https://faucet.apothem.network/) and [https://faucet.goplugin.co/](https://faucet.goplugin.co/) **.**

3. Access [Subscription Manager](http://vrf.goplugin.co/).

4. Initiate the creation of a subscription by selecting 'Create Subscription' and follow the subsequent instructions. If your wallet is linked to the Subscription Manager, the Admin address for your subscription will be pre-populated and non-editable. Optionally, you may input an email address and project name, both of which are kept private. MetaMask prompts for confirmation of the on-chain creation of your subscription account.

5. Upon successful creation, proceed to add funds to your subscription following the provided instructions.

6. To ensure successful processing of your request, it is imperative to sufficiently fund your subscription with PLI to meet the minimum subscription balance requirements, serving as a buffer against gas volatility. A balance of 10 PLI suffices for this example. After transaction approval, MetaMask confirms the transfer of your PLI token to your subscription account.

7. Upon fund addition, proceed to add a consumer. A dedicated page displaying your account details and subscription ID will be presented.

8. Record your subscription ID, essential for your consuming contract, to be added to your subscription subsequently.

## Node Maintenance Instructions
#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/node-maintenance-instructions-for-node-operators\#plugin-node-operators-should-follow-the-below-mentioned-points-to-keep-their-nodes-active-and-can-re)    Plugin node operators should follow the below-mentioned points to keep their nodes active and can reap many benefits in the long run.

1. Keep your nodes 24/7 operational.

2. Make sure you have installed log rotation on your node as per the latest modular node setup script, and clean up the logs(/HOME\_PATH/.pm2/logs/\*.gz, /HOME\_PATH/.plugin/\*.gz) periodically.

3. Node operators who are using Docker (OneClickDeploy) method can clean up the logs in their docker container using the below-mentioned commands.
i) sudo docker exec -it plinode /bin/bash -c "truncate -s 0 ~/.pm2/pm2.log"



ii) sudo docker exec -it plinode /bin/bash -c "truncate -s 0 ~/.plugin/log.jsonl"

4. Check your node dashboard from time to time by logging in with your credentials, to know about your node reputation.

5. Though your node is 24/7 operational and your node is up and running and your reputation went down, please raise a Ticket with your node’s ‘pm2 status’ screenshot as an attachment.

6. Keep a periodic watch on announcement/update through our channels(like Discord, Twitter, etc.,) to get the latest update.

## Plugin 1.0 Node Installation
> plugin-deployment

Please ensure, you have git & curl command installed already. If not, use the following command

sudo apt install git

sudo apt install curl

`Please install an editor of your choice(like vim, nano etc.,) to edit files during installation`

Do a git clone and perform the following actions

git clone [https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment.git](https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin-deployment.git)

cd plugin-deployment

There are two scripts in this folder namely,

- 1\_prerequisite.bash

- 2\_nodeStartPM2.sh


Create two files namely '.env.apicred', '.env.password', by using the below mentioned command in terminal.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
touch .env.apicred
touch .env.password
```

put - the credentials in below format in '.env.apicred' file - these credentials helps you to login your Plugin GUI

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
emailid
password
```

put - password(very strong) in '.env.password' file and it should follow specific format, which is given under NOTE

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
keystorepassword
```

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-1.0-installations-deprecated/how-to-install-plugin-1.0-node/script-method-legacy/script-phase-1\#note)    NOTE:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
.env.password => contains your Keystore password
#  *** KEYSTORE PASSWORD SHOULD FOLLOW THESE CONDITIONS ***
#   “must be longer than 12 characters”,
#   “must contain at least 3 lowercase characters”,
#   “must contain at least 3 uppercase characters”,
#   “must contain at least 3 numbers”,
#   “must contain at least 3 symbols”,
#   “must not contain more than 3 identical consecutive characters”.
```

Before triggering 1\_prerequisite.bash, please ensure to change the password at line number 203. The password should be a strong one as it is a Postgres password. Keep in mind that, the password should not have \* or @ characters

Open the terminal, go to a specific folder, and trigger the bash file like below

> ./1\_prerequisite.bash

What it does?

- It installs all prerequisites for the plugin environment.

- If your system already has a few packages that are necessary for Plugin environment, then the packages will throw error/warning messages and override the same.

- It is always recommended to go with fresh VPS or Machine

- Go to XDCPay or MetaMask where you have XDC / PLI and transfer some funds.


**It is not necessary to dump all the funds here. 10 XDC & 5PLI should be fine to start with.**

**Also, this is not staking!.. It is just to allow your plugin node to process the transaction if any, comes your way.**

**Be cautious to fund your Node address only with the required Tokens for testing (1 to 5PLI max) DO NOT FUND MORE THAN THIS!**

**The user or the Plugin Team will not be able to withdraw any tokens that have been purposefully or mistakenly transferred to a Node address.**

After transferring the funds, you should be able to see it in the PLUGIN GUI like this

## Weather API Adapter Setup
For the demo purpose, we will setup our external adapter to pull the data from weather API. Follow along the following tutorial to understand how it works.

Setting up external initiator requires the following steps to be performed

- Git clone the repository

- cd & npm install

- Include the API endpoint & Parse the payload

- Run the server


Step 1 -

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
git clone https://github.com/GoPlugin/external-adapter-template.git
```

Step 2 -

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
cd weather_adapter
```

Step 3 -

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
npm install
```

Step 4 -

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
map the api endpoint
```

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/external-adapters-plugin-1.0-deprecated/implement-external-adapters\#requesting-data)    Requesting Data

When an external adapter receives a request from the Plugin node, the JSON payload will include the following objects:

- `data` (Guaranteed to be present but may be empty)

- `meta` (Optional, depends on job type)

- `responseURL` (Optional, will be supplied if job supports asynchronous callbacks)

- `id` (Optional, can be nice to use for EA logging to help debug job runs)


Returning Data

When the external adapter wants to return data immediately, it must include `data` in the returned JSON.

An example of the response data can look like this:

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
  "data": {
    "result": "20.04"
  }
}
```

Note - The external adapter that you are running, should be the same URL endpoint mapped in Bridge.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
const { Requester } = require('@goplugin/external-adapter')
require("dotenv").config();

const customError = (data) => {
  if (data.Response === 'Error') return true
  return false
}

const customParams = {
  endpoint: ['endpoint']
}

const createRequest = (input, callback) => {

  const url = `http://<host>/api/${input.data.endpoint}`

  const config = {
    url
  }

  if (process.env.API_KEY) {
    config.headers = {
      Authorization: process.env.API_KEY
    }
  }
  Requester.request(config, customError)
    .then(response => {

      if (input.data.envCheck == "WindDirection") {
        var resultData = response.data[0]['windDirection'];
      } else if (input.data.envCheck == "Temperature") {
        var resultData = response.data[0]['tempC'];
      } else if (input.data.envCheck == "WindChill") {
        var resultData = response.data[0]['windChillC'];
      }
      response.data.result = resultData.toString();

      const res = {
        data: {
          "result": response.data.result.toString()
        }
      }
      callback(response.status, Requester.success(input.id, res));
    })
    .catch(error => {
      callback(500, Requester.errored(input.id, error))
    })
}

module.exports.createRequest = createRequest
```

Let's see what's in " **index**. **js**"

- We are importing 'external-adapter' from goplugin npm using importing methods such as Requester

- Importing "dotenv" module to access the .env file for sensitive info (API\_KEY).

- "customError" is a function to return either true or false if an error occurs.

- "customParams" is a variable to declare parameters to pass on in URL - this can be customized accordingly.

- "createRequest" is the method actually doing the heavy lifting.



- URL is getting defined since for the weather node the endpoint is getting passed via smart contract the "endpoint" is accessed via "input.data.endpoint".

- <host> to be replaced with a respective domain name or IP address where we are fetching the data

- api -> router name. Again for our weather node, we have API as rrouter name for your case it can be a different

- config -> variable name to have url parm

- Next, we are checking API _KEY if exists in env parm, else it will not be applied. For authenticated API, you have to pass API_ KEY

- Requester.request will scan for the payload from the API endpoint and customize the output .. In this example, we are checking "input.data.envCheck".



- Note that, envCheck is a parameter we are passing via smart contract(Check weather node)

- Based on envCheck, the loop iterates and scans the value from the output payload

- Finally we are constructing the response and return


When you run PM2 Start server.js, the server will by default run in port 5001 and just make sure the bridge is correctly pointed out to this port number. For instance, this should be http://localhost:5001/

- contractAddress:The address of the FluxAggregator contract responsible for managing the data feed.

- threshold:Represents the percentage threshold of deviation from the previous on-chain answer. This threshold must be met before a fresh set of observations is submitted to the contract.

- absoluteThreshold(optional):This parameter indicates the absolute numerical deviation necessary from the previous on-chain answer before submitting new observations. It's particularly useful when data can sometimes reach zero, making it impossible to calculate a percentage deviation from zero.

- idleTimerPeriod:Specifies the time interval (starting from the initiation of the last round) after which a new round is automatically triggered. This occurs regardless of any observed off-chain deviations.

- idleTimerDisabled:Determines whether the idle timer is utilized to trigger new rounds.

- drumbeatEnabled:Indicates whether the drumbeat mechanism is employed to initiate new rounds.

- drumbeatSchedule:Defines the cron schedule for the drumbeat. Use the same syntax as the cron job type, and remember to include CRON\_TZ.

- pollTimerPeriod:Sets the frequency at which the off-chain data source is inspected for deviation against the previously submitted on-chain answer.

- pollTimerDisabled:Specifies whether the occasional deviation check is employed to trigger new rounds

## VRF Consumer Contract
> Note:- Steps will remain the same for mainnet deployment as well except the contract deployment in the 3rd step.

01. For this demonstration, utilize the vrf\_subscription\_consumer\_xdc\_apothem.sol contract. This contract imports dependencies including VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol, VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol, and ConfirmedOwner.sol.

02. The contract incorporates preconfigured values for requisite request parameters such as vrfCoordinator address, gas lane keyHash, callbackGasLimit, requestConfirmations, and the number of random words, numWords. For this scenario, specify only the subscriptionId during contract deployment.

03. Open and copy the [vrf\_subscription\_consumer\_xdc\_apothem.sol](https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin_vrf_subscription_consumer_contract/blob/main/vrf_subscription_consumer_xdc_apothem.sol) contract to remix for apothem, and for mainnet open the following contract [vrf\_subscription\_consumer\_xdc\_mainnet.sol](https://github.com/GoPlugin/plugin_vrf_subscription_consumer_contract/blob/main/vrf_subscription_consumer_xdc_mainnet.sol) in remix.

04. Compile the vrf\_subscription\_consumer\_xdc\_apothem contract on the Compile tab in Remix.![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FESOUFtPXIJRxBF9YQbVt%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D6f4237bf-a5e9-4e41-933b-16167ff6e97d&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=b4cbbbcd&sv=2)

05. Configure deployment settings. Select the Injected Provider environment and the vrf\_subscription\_consumer\_xdc\_apothem contract from the contract list on the Deploy tab in Remix. Specify your subscriptionId to allow the constructor to set it. ![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FObskiGS2nHh3WsdNK1pq%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D62e030bb-8f0d-4d42-a105-8c472a646e33&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=92976f2d&sv=2)

06. Click the Deploy button to initiate on-chain deployment of your contract. MetaMask prompts confirmation of the transaction.

07. Upon contract deployment, copy the contract address from the Deployed Contracts list in Remix. Subsequently, add this address as an approved consuming contract on your subscription account before requesting randomness from VRF.

08. Access the [Subscription Manager](http://vrf.goplugin.co/) and select the ID of your new subscription under the My Subscriptions list to view subscription details.

09. Under the Consumers section, click Add consumer.

10. Input the address of your recently deployed consuming contract and click Add consumer. MetaMask prompts confirmation of the transaction.

11. Deployment and Approval of Example Contract


Your example contract is now deployed and approved for utilization of your subscription balance to facilitate VRF requests. Next, proceed to request random values from Plugin VRF.

Deploy the above ClientContract using [http://remix.ethereum.org/](http://remix.ethereum.org/). Once the contract is deployed, it has to be funded(0.2 PLI). For the sake of convenience, we can call the address of this contract **CC** for now.

After deployment, you should fund your client contract with PLI(0.2 PLI)

After the contract is funded it has to be flattened using remix, for the convenience of the user the flattened form of the ClientContract is provided below.

Now you can go to the weather Data UI - [link](https://wfn.goplugin.co/)

## Staking PLI Tokens
Step 1 - Login onto [http://oracles.goplugin.co/](http://oracles.goplugin.co/) using your credential

In the menu section, you can find "Stake" option

As soon as your node is reviewed & approved, you will be able to see your approved node in this section.

For bounty winners, 90% or 50%, the respective token to be staked for the first node. For instance, here this user is not bounty winner so he has to stake 2K PLI node for this address

For 50% bounty winner - They will by default stake 1000 PLI for the first node

For 90% bounty winner - They will by default stake 200 PLI for the first node

Remaining tokens for bounty winner will be staked by Plugin Admin for the first Node.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252F9frKkfVMoRlN4Wrd2F5U%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dcc5985ad-3962-42b5-ae56-4c99ee23d20c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=385eaa4b&sv=2)

> It is very important to note that, your wallet address (XDC Pay) is the default. Staking will take two key parameters as inputs- Your node address & Wallet address.

Staking required two operations to do

- Sign

- Stake


Once you perform both operations successfully, the respective token will be deducted from your wallet address & staked on your behalf.

After you stake successfully, your node will be displayed in the oracle node platform home page below

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FZSSFMw2o46yDfjEAodox%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D2df15d01-8bf2-4560-a995-ab523d207958&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=8f3b2d28&sv=2)

For Bounty Users, after the user stakes the PLI, PLUGIN Admin will stake the remaining tokens. Only then, the node will be displayed on the home page. - So don't be surprised if your node is not visible immediately after you stake if you are a bounty user.

Once you staked, you can see the details in "stake section"

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FNJaKraD0G7NHEX2n7OEa%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd3c2a506-e6c8-467b-916e-8e3fc19da4f2&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=8bd84166&sv=2)

## Plugin Node Migration
Migrating the Plugin node to a new server is easy if you have followed the latest script from our plugin-deployment folder(Modular Script Method). For other steps, such as docker, or an earlier version of plugin deployment adopted by users, new documentation will be shared.

If you have followed the Modular script method(recommended), then please proceed as follows

- Raise a ticket at https://oracles.goplugin.co and keep the Plugin Team informed, with the reason why the migration is to happen (with proper business justification)

- After you get a "Go-ahead" signal, please proceed with the following steps

Please note, while doing this backup, your node address and oracle address may not change. You will have the entire credential as same as your previous server. _**So you should be good with it, and you need not stake or re-stake.**_

During Migration, if you happen to see the changes in your node address (mostly it won't), but if there is any change with your node address. Then you have to request for "Un-stake" and do "Re-stake" again.

Follow this article for Un-staking & Re-staking => [Click Here](https://docs.goplugin.co/node-operators/how-to-un-stake-and-re-stake-it-back)

## Plugin 2.0 Node Setup
● RAM 4GB - 8GB Minimum
● Storage - 50GB - 100 GB

● Ubuntu OS 20.04

● Contabo / Other Cloud which guarantees 99.99% uptime.
NOTE: The node operates on 4GB RAM, but it will become unstable soon. So, we encourage operators to use 8GB RAM. Likewise, the minimum storage is 50GB, we encourage to allocate 100GB of storage.

Cloud hosting is better to provide high availability and good reputation

## Add Bridge to Job Spec
The bridge is another task, which takes control of the external adapter and performs the defined requirements, and gives back the results to the task services.

For instance, this job spec has a set of tasks

- Temperature

- copy

- multiply

- ethuin256

- EthTx


For most of the job specs, we get the Multiply, ethUin256 & etHTX in place. But the other two (temperate, copy) will be changed from job to job.

In this example, the task is to call the bridge which is Temperature, then the temperature will in turn call the server (which runs external-adapter in http://localhost:5000/ endpoint) and bring the results.

The next task, will copy the data from the payload and send it to the next task which is "multiply".

Multiply and then remove the fractions by multiplying with the value given in the contract and the ethuin256 task will convert the results into blockchain understandable format.

Finally, the ethTx task will write the data onto the blockchain.

Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] p-2 [count-reset:line]
{
   "initiators": [{\
	"type": "external",\
	"params": {\
		"name": "xdc",\
		"body": {\
			"endpoint": "xdc",\
			"addresses": ["0x88b1718fa0C01459e0A6a42Ec9AFdB299613d30F"]\
			}\
	}\
     }],
     "tasks":
         [   {\
	     "type": "Temperature"\
	     },\
	     {\
	     "type": "copy",\
		 "params": {\
		    "copyPath": [\
			"result"\
				]\
		 }\
	     },\
	     {\
		"type": "multiply"\
	     },\
	     {\
		"type": "ethuint256"\
	     },\
	     {\
		"type": "EthTx"\
	     }\
	 ]
 }
```

Similarly, the bridge can perform any task and bring value to the prescribed format.

Implementing an external adapter - custom logic is with the user.

## Unstake PLI Tokens
## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/plugin-2.0-node-operators/unstake-pli-tokens-from-plugin-1.0-node\#steps-to-unstake-pli-from-plugin-1.0-nodes)    STEPS TO UNSTAKE PLI FROM PLUGIN 1.0 NODES

1. Unstake your Plugin 1.0 Node.



- Members who have completed one year of staking and haven’t activated restaking can find a**button to request the unstaking of the node in the Oracles platform**.

- The other option for members who have enabled restaking would need to raise a Ticket to unstake your Plugin1.0 Node.
While raising the ticket, in “Issue Description:” please provide the below-mentioned details.
**a) IP address: <IP address of your node on which you want to unstake>**
**b) Stake ID: <Staking ID>**
**c) Node Address:<Node\_Address>**
**d) Restake ID:<Restake\_ID>**


The IP address of your node can be found in your [https://oracles.goplugin.co](https://oracles.goplugin.co/) dashboard as mentioned in the image below.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh7-us.googleusercontent.com%2F5v_tXQn5KkMVsK-jQTd7qMirMDOIMvNW01yBVzmrIDheKE5jjEDqbkXI8EV-aCCiGvo7_qPRvDv-cXNqqnPx0T5JWccGg9xrLtu35jutPKSll0NB-z7hRq05cu-QVILNpPWAkjlgYQWIBuFWd2GjKGc&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=7be85baa&sv=2)

Your node's stake ID and node Address can be found in your [https://oracles.goplugin.co](https://oracles.goplugin.co/) dashboard as mentioned in the image below.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh7-us.googleusercontent.com%2Fme-mwLxHYEFcAuwuCR-P3fhlSS_J4Q4jmUDRtrUMZ0YjZfSQxF9C82gZSkqv5anpgUoM5IxdZdYWoKmeoLJsIiA55AP-joEZggX56kpEbSXUu1XDtgl62qyx9JsdDeQVrJaKx1oIWh8IleinsmQbC6g&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=4a2e3694&sv=2)

Your node's ReStake ID and node Address can be found in your [https://oracles.goplugin.co](https://oracles.goplugin.co/) dashboard as mentioned in the image below.
**Note :-** Cumulative tokens must reach 500 to get paid and this will get auto-calculated when the node is in the staking pool. Once the node is in un-staked status, the cumulative tokens will not be incurred further.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FrgAznL3npQDmoBNijZs6%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D88fe3bff-f6f8-4172-a690-6d31dc009185&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=48346458&sv=2)

NOTE: In Plugin2.0 we do not support the Docker Method of node installation, we do support only script-based node installation. To refresh the Docker-based Plugin1.0 node to Plugin2.0, refreshing the node with your VPS service provider is the better option.

1. Once the node is unstaked, withdraw the PLIs to your registered wallet account.

2. Now you can reset your node with the help of your VPS provider or else you can use the script ‘reset\_pli.sh’ which will be found in your “plugin\_deployment” directory (If you installed Plugin1.0 using “Modular Method”).

3. If you are selecting the 'reset\_pli.sh' option to refresh your node, then remove the following lines from your "~/.profile".

export GOROOT=...............
export GOPATH=................
export FEATURE\_EXTERNAL\_INITIATORS=true

And for "export PATH" entry, remove "$GOROOT/bin", "$GOPATH/bin" alone from PATH variable. Now run "source ~/.profile" in the cli of your node.

## Acurite Weather Unit Guide
We are currently supporting Ambient weather Unit, existing Acurite weather unit in WFN data transmission is accepted. Furthermore, there will not be any Approval on any new Acurite weather unit for Plugin WFN. Members are requested to purchase Ambient weather unit.

**Plugin WFN - Acurite Weather Unit Onboarding Instructions**

On this page you will be guided to fetch the information from your sensor and register with Plugin.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.goplugin.co/use-cases/plugin-wfn-use-case/plugin-wfn-acurite-weather-unit-onboarding-instructions-legacy\#collecting-information-from-your-acurite-dashboard)    Collecting information from your Acurite Dashboard:

To collect Device Id, Latitude, and Longitude. Go to myAcurite Dashboard of your sensor and click on 'Settings'.

When you click 'Settings' you will get a drop down, in which ‘Account Profile’ is displayed as an option. Click on ‘Account Profile’ which will take you to your ‘Account Profile’ page.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FEyZinshhU2eflZ8lmwn1%252F0%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=a9ca3ab7&sv=2)

Next to the ‘Account Profile’ tab you can find the ‘Devices’ tab, click on the ‘Devices’ tab wherein you can find the information of your Device id, Latitude, and Longitude.

![](https://docs.goplugin.co/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1713380242-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fl1AVRR4cLSYjVp62RmtY%252Fuploads%252FUM3yA0dJHnRkd2dgIlSh%252F1%3Falt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=a5dda76a&sv=2)

Copy this info and store it in a file. In the device ID remove the intermittent ‘:’ and keep it handy.

If you are able to register your sensor with your latitude/longitude with the myAcurite portal then you can consider that as the correct one. For people who purchased myAcurite in a different region wherein, myAcurite did not allow you to register with your country/state/city latitude/longitude then you can get your latitude/longitude information through ‘google maps’ and locate your exact location using maps and right-click to get the lat & long info and keep it handy.

## Unstake Plugin Node 1.0 and migrate to Plugin 2.0

_Note:- Currently Node onboarding has been stopped, as we have crossed our deadline._

1. Unstake your Plugin 1.0 Node.
1. Members who have completed one year of staking and haven’t activated restaking can find a button to request the unstaking of the node in the Oracles platform.
2. The other option for members who have enabled restaking would need to raise a Ticket to unstake your Plugin1.0 Node. While raising the ticket, in “Issue Description:” please provide the below-mentioned details. a) IP address: <IP address of your node on which you want to unstake> b) Stake ID: <Staking ID>
3. Node Address:<Node\_Address>

      The IP address of your node can be found in your [https://oracles.goplugin.co](https://oracles.goplugin.co/) dashboard as mentioned in the image below.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5v_tXQn5KkMVsK-jQTd7qMirMDOIMvNW01yBVzmrIDheKE5jjEDqbkXI8EV-aCCiGvo7_qPRvDv-cXNqqnPx0T5JWccGg9xrLtu35jutPKSll0NB-z7hRq05cu-QVILNpPWAkjlgYQWIBuFWd2GjKGc)

Your node's stake ID and node Address can be found in your [https://oracles.goplugin.co](https://oracles.goplugin.co/) dashboard as mentioned in the image below.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/me-mwLxHYEFcAuwuCR-P3fhlSS_J4Q4jmUDRtrUMZ0YjZfSQxF9C82gZSkqv5anpgUoM5IxdZdYWoKmeoLJsIiA55AP-joEZggX56kpEbSXUu1XDtgl62qyx9JsdDeQVrJaKx1oIWh8IleinsmQbC6g)

NOTE: In Plugin2.0 we do not support the Docker Method of node installation, we do support only script-based node installation. To refresh the Docker-based Plugin1.0 node to Plugin2.0, refreshing the node with your VPS service provider is the better option.

2\. Once the node is unstaked, withdraw the PLIs to your registered wallet account.

3\. Now you can reset your node with the help of your VPS provider or else you can use the script ‘reset\_pli.sh’ which will be found in your “plugin\_deployment” directory (If you installed Plugin1.0 using “Modular Method”).

These terms of service, together with any documents and additional terms they incorporate by reference (collectively, these “Terms”), are entered into between GoPlugin (“Plugin,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) and you or the company or other legal entity that you represent (“you” or “your”).

Please read these Terms carefully as they govern your use of our site located at goplugin.co and all associated sites (the "Website") and our Services (defined below) and describe your rights and obligations and our disclaimers and limitations of legal liability. By accessing or using any part of the Website or the Services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use our Website or the Services. Please carefully review the disclosures and disclaimers set forth in Section 8 in their entirety before accessing the Website, our Services, or using any software developed by Plugin. Please refer to our privacy policy available at [https://goplugin.co/privacy.html](https://goplugin.co/privacy.html) for information about how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process information about you.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes by sending an email, providing a notice through the Website or our Services or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, any modifications are effective immediately, and your continued use of the Website or our Services will confirm your acceptance of the changes.

**1\. SERVICES**

The Website enables users to access open-source documentation and related services, including (without limitation) oracle and node operator software and resources, data and computation services, information about the software (“Plugin Network”), and resources for the Plugin community (the “Services”). Some Services offered by us or other participants in the XDC Network require payment or otherwise involve the use of an underlying blockchain or other decentralized or permission infrastructure (“Distributed Ledger Technology”), which may require that you pay a fee, such as “gas” charges on the XDC network, for the computational resources required to perform a transaction on the particular Distributed Ledger Technology (such payments and fees, “Charges”). You acknowledge and agree that Plugin has no control over any Distributed Ledger Technology transactions, the method of payment of any Charges, if applicable, or any actual payments of Charges, if applicable. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable Distributed Ledger Technology network tokens stored at your Distributed Ledger Technology-compatible wallet address (“Distributed Ledger Technology Address”) to complete any transaction on the Plugin Network or the Distributed Ledger Technology before initiating such a transaction

**2\. YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; CONDITIONS**

You must be able to form a legally binding contract online either on behalf of a company or as an individual to use the Website or the Services. Accordingly, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind the company or other legal entity to these Terms (if you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity) and you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you reside, whichever is older), can form a legally binding contract online, and have the full, right, power and authority to enter into and to comply with the obligations under these Terms. Additionally, you represent and warrant that you are not a citizen or resident of a state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction that is embargoed by the Sharjah UAE or where your use of the Website or the Services would be illegal or otherwise violate any domestic or foreign law, rule, statute, regulation, by-law, order, protocol, code, decree, or another directive, requirement or guideline, published or in force which applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person, property, transaction, activity, event or other matter, including any rule, order, judgment, directive or other requirement or guideline issued by any domestic or foreign federal, provincial or state, municipal, local or other governmental, regulatory, judicial or administrative authority having jurisdiction over Plugin, you, the Website or the Services, or as otherwise duly enacted, enforceable by law, the common law or equity (“Applicable Law”).

As a condition to accessing or using the Services or the Website, you represent, warrant, and agree that you: (i) will only use the Services and the Website for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms; (ii) will ensure that all information that you provide on the Website is current, complete, and accurate; (iii) will maintain the security and confidentiality of access to your Distributed Ledger Technology Address; and (iv) agree (A) that no Protected Party (defined below) will be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any interactions you have with other users of the Website, Services or the Plugin Network, including any loss of Plugin’s utility tokens (“PLI Tokens”), any other tokens or another unit of value; and (B) if there is a dispute between you and any other site or another user, no Protected Party will be under any

**3\. CHANGES; SUSPENSION; TERMINATION**

The Plugin Network is intended to be decentralized and self-operating, with or without any Services provided by Plugin. Accordingly, we may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you, modify, suspend or disable, temporarily or permanently, the Services offered by Plugin, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, as a result of a security incident.

We will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any Services or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of the Website or the Services.

All of these terms will survive any termination of your access to the Website or the Services, regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive.

**4\. ELECTRONIC NOTICES**

You consent to receive all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures electronically (collectively, our “Communications”) that we provide in connection with these Terms or any Services. You agree that we may provide our Communications to you by posting them on the Website or through the Services or by emailing them to you at the email address you provide in connection with using the Services. You should maintain copies of our communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You may also contact our support team to request additional electronic copies of our Communications by filing a support request at [support@goplugin.co](mailto:support@goplugin.co)

**5\. INDEMNIFICATION**

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Plugin, our affiliates, and our and our affiliates’ respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, licensors, and contractors (collectively, Protected Parties”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Website, Services, the Plugin Network or PLIL Tokens, Distributed Ledger Technology assets associated with your Distributed Ledger Technology Address, any other digital assets, any Feedback or User Content; your violation of these Terms; your violation of Applicable Law or regulations; or your infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If you are obligated to indemnify any Protected Party, Plugin (or, at its discretion, the applicable Protected Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Plugin wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms.

**6\. DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS**

The Website, the Services, and the Plugin open-source software do not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other asset. The plugin is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person.

The plugin does not own or control the underlying software protocols that are used in connection with the Pli Tokens. In general, the underlying protocols are open-source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. The plugin is not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols, and the Plugin makes no guarantee of its functionality, security, or availability.

To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Website and the Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Website or the Services (including any related data) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time, or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Website or the Service are correctable or will be corrected.

You acknowledge that your data on the Website or through the Services may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or other technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your computer equipment), protocol changes by third-party providers, Internet outages, force majeure events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside our control.

The disclaimer of implied warranties contained in these Terms may not apply if and to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the Applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

It is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR - Do Your Own Research) and exercise caution before making any investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can experience significant fluctuations within short periods. Past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee of any specific outcomes or returns. The value of cryptocurrencies can rise or fall rapidly, and investors may experience substantial gains or losses.

We strongly recommend consulting with a professional financial advisor or conducting independent research before making any investment decisions. We are not responsible for any financial losses, damages, or consequences arising from the use of information provided on this website or any affiliated platforms.

Please note that regulations, laws, and market conditions related to cryptocurrencies may change, and it is your responsibility to stay informed about any updates or developments in the field.

This disclaimer applies to the entire content of this website and all affiliated platforms.

**7\. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES**

In no event will Plugin, together with any Protected Party, be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Website, the Services and the Plugin Network (and any of their content and functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other digital assets, PLI Tokens or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of a Protected Party, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not any Protected Party has been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy nor is Plugin in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of Plugin open-source software or the Plugin Network.

**Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**

Administered by: Us

Purpose:These Cookies identify if users have accepted the use of cookies on the Website.

**8\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

In no event will the Protected Parties' aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Website, the Services, and the Plugin Network (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or nonperformance of the Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other digital assets, PLI Tokens or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of a Protected Party, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability exceed the number of fees paid by you to us under these Terms in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.

**9\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION**

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Plugin and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us unless you opt-out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

You and Plugin agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Plugin and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or Plugin seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes in which you or Plugin seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Plugin waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Plugin or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Plugin and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Plugin by email at support@goplugin.co or Contact C.01.01, first floor, Sharjah Research Technology, and Innovation Park P.O. Box 66636 Sharjah, UAE. The Notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim, and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Plugin cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to AAA will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in the Sharjah UAE, in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”). The most recent version of the AAA Rules is available on the AAA website and is hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or waive your opportunity to read the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and Plugin agree that the enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitrator, Plugin, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

You and Plugin agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Plugin will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Plugin, Plugin will pay all AAA fees and costs. You and Plugin agree that the courts of Sharjah sitting in the UAE have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Plugin will not have the right to assert the claim.

You have the right to opt-out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 12 by emailing us at info@goplugin.co. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration.

If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms, severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 12, and to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will stay pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 12 will be enforceable. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 12.

**10\. GOVERNING LAW**

The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Website, or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Sharjah UAE, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the Sharjah UAE or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in Sharjah UAE will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.

**11\. RISK FACTORS**

You acknowledge the following serious risks to any use of the Website or the Services or the PLI Token and expressly agree to not hold any Protected Parties liable should any of the following risks occur:

Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions: The Website or the Services or the PLI Token could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Plugin to continue to develop the Website or Services, or which could impede or limit your ability to use the Website or Services or the PLI Token.

Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Plugin Networks: It is possible that alternative Plugin-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open-source code and open-source protocol underlying the Plugin Network and/or Services. The Plugin Network may compete with these alternative Plugin-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Plugin Network, the Services, and/or the PLI Token.

Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Plugin Network or Distributed Applications: It is possible that Plugin Network will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be a limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Plugin Network and the potential uses of PLI Tokens. The plugin cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.

The risk that the Website and Services, as Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of the User: You recognize that the Website, Services, and the Plugin Network are under development and may undergo significant changes over time. You acknowledge that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Plugin Network held by you may not be met for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans, specifications, and execution of the implementation of the Website, Services or the Plugin Network.

Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Plugin Network Core Infrastructure Software: The Website, Services, and the Plugin Network rest on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Protected Parties, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Plugin, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Website, Services or the Plugin Network causing the system to lose PLI Tokens stored in one or more of your accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Website, Services and the Plugin Network, the Website, Services, and the Plugin Network may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Website, Services, the Plugin Network and PLI Tokens.

Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography: Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Website, Services, and the Plugin Network which could result in the theft or loss of PLI Tokens. To the extent within its control and otherwise possible, Plugin intends to update the protocol underlying the Services and the Plugin Network to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.

Risk of Blockchain Network Attacks: Any blockchain used for the Services and/or the Plugin Network may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: double-spend attacks, reorganizations, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and work race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Services, the Plugin Network, the expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and the expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be successful.

Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power of the Services and the Plugin Network: If the Services and/or the Plugin Network are rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which Plugin services can be provided. Under such a scenario, the Services and Plugin Network could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Services, the Plugin Network, and PLI Tokens. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of PLI Tokens could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This could result in lost revenues and disruption or halting of business operations.

Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws: The Plugin Network, and by extension the Website and Services, may be subject to a variety of international laws and regulations, including those with respect to financial or securities regulations, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation, and others. Such laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting Plugins could be enacted. As the Website, Services and Plugin Network evolve, we may be subject to new laws, and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of the Plugin’s attention and resources or restrict the way the Plugin may operate. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely impact the Website, Services, and the Plugin Network and PLI Tokens. Additionally, Plugin node operators of the Plugin Network may be subject to industry-specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fail to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, the Plugin Network and/or PLI Tokens could be adversely impacted.

Market Risks: PLI Tokens are intended to be used solely in connection with the Plugin Network, and we do not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of PLI Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using PLI Tokens, and could therefore create illiquidity risk to PLI Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of PLI Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to PLI Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.

Specific Risks Relating to Value and Function of PLI Tokens: The utility benefits of using PLI Tokens to access services provided by Plugin node operators can only materialize through user-driven adoption over time. Such adoption depends on a variety of factors, including the pace of user adoption, and the organic community-driven expansion of the Plugin Network. As such, the extent of user adoption is entirely outside of our control and cannot be stated with any certainty. The price of PLI Tokens may fluctuate in response to competitive and market conditions affecting the general supply of and demand for user-requested services. These conditions are beyond our control. The value of PLI Tokens on the Plugin Network may be lower than the price at which it was purchased. The utility of PLI Tokens, and any value associated with that utility, will depend on the ability of the Plugin Network to adequately facilitate user-requested services. Inadequate supply may result in such services taking more time, while inadequate demand may make it difficult to obtain services, both of which may discourage participation in the Plugin Network. The compensation for providing Plugin node services in the Plugin Network will depend on the resale price for the PLI Tokens received for such services, which may be lower than the compensation that might have been received through other arrangements. No promises of future performance or value are or will be made with respect to PLI Token, including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no guarantee that PLI Token will hold any particular value.

Unanticipated Risks: Cryptographic tokens such as PLI Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in these Terms, there are other risks associated with the Services, the Plugin Network and PLI Tokens, including those that the Plugin cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in these Terms.

**12\. MISCELLANEOUS**

Any right or remedy of Plugin set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Website or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Website or the Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Website and the Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.

## SynthX Lab - Synthetix Derivatives Protocol

Inspired by the Synthetix Derivatives Protocol, **SynthX Lab** was created as a crypto-backed synthetic asset platform built on the XDC Network.

SynthX Lab's primary goal is to provide exposure to real-world assets—such as cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and commodities—without requiring users to hold the actual assets themselves

It operates as a multi-token system powered by XDC and/or PLI tokens. XDC or PLI holders can stake their tokens to mint xdUSD, a stablecoin backed by cryptocurrency. These xdUSD tokens can then be swapped for an expanding range of synthetic assets and commodities through Smart Contracts. Currently, SynthX Lab is deployed on the Apothem network and is expected to launch on MAINNET based on community feedback.

The prices of these synthetic assets are obtained from Plugin's Decentralized Oracle Network.

## Operations and functionalities of SynthX Lab

SynthX Lab is a decentralized protocol for issuing synthetic assets, built on the XDC Network. These assets are collateralized by XDC or PLI tokens, which, when locked in a smart contract, enable the creation of synthetic USD (xdUSD) tokens. This pooled collateral model allows users to exchange synthetic assets (Synths) directly with the smart contract, eliminating the need for counterparties. This approach addresses the liquidity and slippage challenges often faced by decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Currently, SynthX Lab supports synthetic cryptocurrencies, with plans to expand to synthetic fiat currencies and commodities in the future.

## How does the rewards penalty system work ?

Penalties will be calculated as the total monthly reward minus (the number of inactive days multiplied by the per-day incentive).

Even one hour of downtime will be reflected in the reduction of the per-day incentive.

To further elaborate, Firstly, the number of inactive days is calculated using multiple levels of testing on the node, and then that is multiplied by the per-day incentive. After which the value is subtracted from the monthly reward calculated for that node.
